female with prolonged hospitalization who had high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) secondary to Acetaminophen-induced pyroglutamate excretion.", "31 y/o F with a past medical history significant for traumatic brain injury secondary to a motor vehicle accident, seizure disorder, bowel perforation status post ileostomy who presented with Pneumonia and UTI (Urinary tract infection) from MDR (multidrug-resistant) organisms, also found to have HAGMA for which Nephrology was consulted.\n\nThe patient had a very prolonged hospitalization which was met with multiple complications. She was noted to have HAGMA of 26 and a serum bicarbonate level of 12. Her VBG showed a pH of 7.17, PCO2 of 36, and HCO3 of 13, her delta gap was 1.16 indicating pure HAGMA. Appropriate workup was done which showed negative ACTH stimulation test, creatine phosphokinase levels <10, Lactic acid at 2.0 mmol/L, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels were 0.27 mmol/L, free valproic acid at 4.7 (4.8-17.3 ug/ml), topiramate levels at 6.8 (5-20 ug/ml), Acetaminophen and aspirin levels were undetectable. Ethanol levels were not checked but she had no exposure to it due to the prolonged hospitalization, all medications were reviewed, and propylene glycol was not used as a solvent in any of the meds. Her renal function showed serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl, but it was unreliable as she was severely malnourished, urine anion gap was positive. She was started on sodium bicarbonate tablets 650 mg q 8 hours and then transitioned to a bicarbonate drip with 150 meq/L in 1 L of sterile water. Upon further review, it was noted that she had been getting oral acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours as needed intermittently for pain, this prompted us to send serum and urine organic acid panel using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry which revealed massive excretion of pyroglutamate in the urine. Her Acetaminophen was stopped and a week later her serum bicarbonate levels improved to 24 without needing any further NaHCO3 tablets.", "High anion gap metabolic acidosis due to acquired deficiency of glutathione in malnourished patients who are exposed chronically to Acetaminophen is underinvestigated and underreported. This should be considered as a differential, especially in women with prolonged hospitalization and sepsis when evaluating HAGMA."], ["Sengers syndrome (SS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in acylglycerol kinase (AGK) gene. We report a case of an adult female referred to the nephrology clinic with chronic lactic acidosis, diagnosed clinically and undergoing genetic work up for SS.", "30 y/o F, born of consanguineous parents, with history of chronic myalgias, asthenia, exercise intolerance, open angle glaucoma, and congenital cataracts is found to have chronic lactic acidosis. Her serologies are remarkable for AST at 55 U/L, ALT at 41 U/L, aldolase at 13.4 U/L, lactic acid at 7.6 mmol/L, LDH at 220 U/L, CK at 504 U/L. Urine lactic acid at 92 mmol/mol creat.

It is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, exercise intolerance, and lactic acidosis. SS is usually diagnosed in infancy yet that is not the case with this patient. Being a very rare disease, its phenotype/genotype is still uncertain. AGK is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid which acts as a second messenger regulating several cellular processes and plays an important role in the synthesis of phospholipids. Multiple studies found oxidative phosphorylation defects in SS and suggested that mitochondrial respiration and metabolism are affected in the absence of AGK. SS can have high mortality rate due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, yet in our patient TTE showed only mild hypertrophy. SS can be differentiated from other hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated genetic disorders by its high incidence of ocular lesions. A distinctive feature is the development of marked lactic acidosis on slight muscular exercise for which our patient has been told to avoid any strenuous activity. Much is still to be understood about SS, yet strong clinical suspicion is needed when a patient presents with ocular lesions, lactic acidosis, muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy clinical features."], ["We present a case of anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) secondary to severe lactate production due to metformin overdose in an 18-year-old woman, highlighting metabolic derangements ensuing the need for hemodialysis.", "An 18 y/o woman with past medical history of depression and recently diagnosed diabetes mellitus presented to us two hours after attempting suicide by ingesting over a hundred Metformin 1000mg tablets.\n\nOn evaluation, she reported two episodes of emesis prior to arrival.

However, despite adequate intravenous fluids, the patient\u2019s kidney function did not improve as excepted, which in addition to the patient\u2019s age and the anemia, prompted further workup. The patient was then found to have an IgG-kappa monoclonal gammopathy, which led to a bone marrow biopsy revealing 20% plasma cells. The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.", "Although the hypercalcemia was likely driven by the parathyroid adenoma given the degree of PTH elevation, we suspect that the multiple myeloma was also likely contributing. Interestingly, although the exact mechanism remains unknown, there are numerous case reports, dating back decades, and even a small prospective study describing an association between monoclonal gammopathies, including multiple myeloma, and primary hyperparathyroidism.3,4,5 Given the prevalence of reported cases, some authors suggest ruling out a coexisting monoclonal gammopathy at the time of diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in the elderly and those with difficult to control hypercalcemia.5,6,7 As seen in this case, had it not been for the additional lab abnormalities the diagnosis of myeloma would have likely been delayed. Thus, this case gives us an opportunity to highlight a clinically important association between primary hyperparathyroidism and monoclonal gammopathies."], ["Hypercalcemia occasionally develops following renal recovery from rhabdomyolysis.

In our patient, however, this caused an increase in serum calcium. Amiloride is theorized to induce hypercalcemia by increasing calcium reabsorption in the late distal convoluted tubule and the connecting tubule. While the mechanism is not fully known, it is thought that diuretic induced cellular hyperpolarization results in an increased electrical gradient that favors calcium reabsorption.

Initial renal ultrasound(US) was normal; however, an abdominal US 11 days later showed extensive multiple bilateral kidney stones, largest measuring 10 mm, resulting in pelvicalyceal dilation bilaterally, with bilateral ureteral dilation from calculi and bladder wall calcification. Stone formation was initially attributed to furosemide (given 7 days), topiramate (11 days), and ketogenic diet (1 month). However, the patient continued to form numerous bilateral stones for several months after discontinuation of all 3 factors, requiring repeated lithotripsy, stone extraction, and bilateral ureteral stenting to relieve obstruction.

Staining for phospho-STAT1 was enhanced in GC regions of palatine tonsils from IgAN patients compared to CT groups. IgA1-producing cells derived from tonsils of patients with IgAN, compared to those of CT, exhibited enhanced STAT1 phosphorylation and elevated Gd-IgA1 production in response to LIF, but not OSM. JAK2 inhibitor and STAT1 siRNA knock-down blocked these LIF-induced effects.", "In summary, palatine-tonsil-derived IgA1-producing cells exhibit dysregulation of LIF-mediated signaling resulted in Gd-IgA1 overproduction.

Isolated leukocytes from murine kidney were analysed by flow cytometry. To check whether PCs are present in the patient's kidneys, the kidney biopsy specimens from patients with IgAN were stained with anti-human IgA and CD138 antibodies. To investigate whether the IgA+ PCs in the kidney of gddY mice are generated in T cell-dependent or independent manner, we sequenced the variable region of IgA heavy and light chains from single IgA+ PCs isolated from the kidney of gddY mice.", "We found that a significant number of IgA+ PCs accumulated in the kidneys of gddY mice. The IgA+ PCs emerge by 8 weeks of age and further increased with age in gddY mice. Immunohistochemical staining of kidney biopsy samples from IgAN patients revealed the presence of IgA+ PCs cells in the tubulointerstitial region of the kidney. Most of the heavy- and light-chain V region genes from IgA+ PCs in the kidney of gddY mice contained significant numbers of somatic mutations that replaced amino-acids, indicating that these PCs were generated in a T-cell-dependent manner through the germinal center.", "We found that IgA+ PCs accumulate in the kidneys of gddY mice and IgAN patients and these IgA+ PCs are generated in T-cell-dependent manner.

We found that in IgAN patients with downregulated VTRNA2-1, PKR is overactivated, coherently with the role of the VTRNA2-1 that binds to PKR and inhibits its phosphorylation. The loss of the VTRNA2-1 natural restrain caused the activation of CREB by PKR, a classical cAMP-inducible CRE-binding factor interacting with a region of the IL-6 promoter and leading to IL-6 production. We found higher CREB phosphorylation levels and IL-6 levels both in IgAN and in TP-IgAN patients. Since PKR is normally activated by bacterial and viral RNA, we hypothesized that these microorganisms can further activate the PKR/CREB/IL-6 pathway leading to an excess of IL-6 production, explaining both the high levels of IL-6, both infection involvement in the disease, both cases of IgAN associated with COVID-19 infection and with COVID-19 RNA-vaccination.
