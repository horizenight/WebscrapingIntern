injury (AKI) is defined through serum creatinine and urine output metrics. However, these markers do not capture the complexity of AKI and do not fully inform on the future risk of kidney and clinical events.", "We evaluated clinical and biomarker data from AKI patients during the acute hospitalization from ASSESS-AKI via three machine learning algorithms to uncover different AKI composites. We compared key characteristics within each subphenotype via classic statistics and then examined the time to event for kidney events (CKD incidence and progression), cardiovascular events, and death by subphenotype.", "We included 748 AKI patients. The mean age (\u00b1 SD) was 64 (13) years, 67.9% were men, and the median follow-up was 4.8 years. Patients with AKI subphenotype 1 (\u2018cardiorenal injury\u2019, N=181) were characterized by prevalent CVD (78%, P<0.001) and the highest levels of KIM-1, urinary IL-18, and Troponin T. Subphenotype 2 (\u2018benign\u2019, N=250) was comprised of individuals with a low prevalence of comorbid conditions and high uromodulin levels, a marker of tubular repair. AKI subphenotype 3 (\u2018cardiorenal inflammation, N=159) comprised patients with markedly high levels of pro-BNP, TNFRs and low kidney injury (KIM-1, NGAL). Finally, patients subphenotype 4 (\u2018sepsis-AKI\u2019, N=158) had high rates of infections and dialysis-requiring AKI. These patients had the highest levels of vascular/kidney (YKL-40, MCP-1), and injury activity. AKI subphenotype 3 and 4 were independently associated with a higher risk of death: adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 2.9 (95% CI: 1.8 \u2013 4.6, p<0.001) and 1.6 (1.01 \u2013 2.6, p=0.04), respectively. Subphenotype 3 was also independently associated with triple the risk of CKD outcomes (aHR: 2.6, CI: 1.6 \u2013 4.2) and CVD events (aHR: 2.6, CI: 1.6 \u2013 4.1).", "We discovered four novel and clinically meaningful AKI subphenotypes that inform on potential pathway abnormalities that associate with differing risks for long-term events. We found a new role for biomarkers when they are evaluated in an agnostic fashion, which can serve to advance precision medicine in AKI care."], ["Early prediction of AKI ahead of 24 to 48 hours window has now been proposed as a possible strategy to prevent or alleviate AKI by providing clinicians sufficient time for timely intervention.

Adult ICU admissions from 2018-2020 in four other medical centers were used as external validation cohort. AKI labelling is based on 2012 KDIGO AKI definition. A parsimonious prediction model was selected by LASSO and deployed to the 2018-2020 external validation cohort at 4 other medical centers.

The machine learning algorithm for AKI prediction revealed XGBoost with better performance metrics in terms of sensitivity:0.795, specificity:0.866, AUROC:0.911, precision:0.726, and accuracy:0.844, and decision curve analysis. After applying LASSO for parsimonious prediction model for external validation at these 4 hospitals showed the prediction performance with AUROC ranging from 0.785 to 0.864. Federated learning using neuron network algorithm improved the prediction performance.", "AKI is common in ICU with poor prognosis. Early prediction ahead of 24-48 hours may help clinicians for timely intervention to prevent it from happening. We demonstrate the concept of artificial intelligence as medical assistance to clinicians in a feasible way.", ""], ["EHR data is increasingly utilized in large studies investigating in-hospital AKI. Although such studies often attempt to use guideline criteria to diagnose AKI, there is often variability in the methodologies. We have hence developed the AKI Flagger-an open-source tool to help standardize the definition of AKI in large database studies.", "The AKI Flagger tool employs three techniques to operationalize the definition of AKI using the KDIGO serum creatinine(SCr) criteria for AKI: Rolling Minimum Window(RMW, using 48hour and 7day windows), Historical Baseline Trumping(HBT, median SCr within 7-365days pre-AKI) and Baseline Creatinine Imputation(BCI, imputed from eGFR 75mL/min/1.73m2). The flagger was internally validated in a cohort of 40,106 adult inpatients at 6 hospitals. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of various AKI definitions in predicting stage 2 AKI, dialysis, and death.", "The incidence of AKI was higher using BCI(40.0%) compared to the HBT(31.1%) and RMW(26.1%) techniques. AKI was detected earlier with BCI(median 0.9d, IQR:0.0-5.7), followed by HBT(median 2.7d, IQR:0.0-8.1), and RMW(median 4.2d, IQR:1.6-10.3). AKI diagnosed using RMW was associated with the highest percentage of dialysis(3.2 vs 2.7 vs 2.1%) and mortality(8.0 vs 7.3 vs 6.2%), and the longest hospital stay(9.01 vs 8.31 vs 8.03 days) compared to HBT and BCI, respectively. BCI had the highest sensitivity(0.93) and lowest specificity(0.69) for AKI progression with an AUC of 0.81. RMW had the lowest sensitivity(0.87) and highest specificity(0.83) for predicting AKI progression with an AUC of 0.85.", "The incidence of AKI and related outcomes vary according to the definition and timeframe used.

These sub-phenotypes differ in clinical outcomes and treatment response, though biologic mechanisms underlying these sub-phenotypes remain unknown.", "We prospectively enrolled 120 ICU patients with suspected infection (including COVID-19), both with AKI (n=62) and without (n=58), collecting matched blood and urine within 24 hours of ICU admission. We classified patients with AKI as AKI-SP1 (n=45) or AKI-SP2 (n=17) using three plasma biomarkers: angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. Using the SomaScan \u00ae platform to measure 5,212 urinary proteins, we compared urinary proteins in patients with and without AKI and between patients with AKI-SP1 and AKI-SP2, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and COVID infection using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05.", "AKI-SP2 had higher risk for new dialysis (OR=12.2; 95% CI: 2.0-73.1; p=0.006) compared to AKI-SP1, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and COVID infection. No urinary proteins were differentially expressed in patients with and without AKI (Figure 1A). In patients with AKI, 194 proteins were significantly higher in the urine in AKI-SP2, and 296 proteins were higher in AKI-SP1 (Figure 1B). Proteins involved in inflammation, chemoattraction of neutrophils and monocytes (CXCL1 and CCL14) and oxidative stress (SOD2) were associated with AKI-SP2, while proteins involved in collagen deposition (GP6), podocyte derived (SPOCK2), and mesenchymal cell proliferation (IL11RA) were associated with AKI-SP1.", "In patients with sepsis-induced AKI, we identified 490 urinary proteins that differed significantly between two AKI sub-phenotypes. The alternative functions of these proteins suggest heterogeneity in the pathophysiology that drives AKI in sepsis and supports the value of AKI sub-phenotypes for the identification of novel pathways in AKI development.", ""], ["Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent complication of hemodialysis, occurring in about one-third of patients. The importance of IDH is given by its association with potential severe clinical outcomes.

In the four mouse models, grip strength was significantly reduced. In CKD and klotho deficient mice, muscle mass, cross-sectional area of myofibers was reduced, and the expression levels of atrogenes were elevated when compared to respective controls. Furthermore, we detected elevations in the mRNA and protein levels of FGF23 in the hindlimb muscles of all models.

At baseline, muscle RANKL and FGF21 genes were upregulated (16-fold, p=0.002; and 6-fold, p=0.06, respectively), when compared to controls, with no effect of PTX. Conversely, FNDC5 was downregulated (3.2-fold, p=0.034), and PTX led to its increase (2-fold, p <0.01).", "Patients with SHPT on dialysis submitted to PTX experienced a marked improvement in bone mass and muscular function, but not in muscle mass.

Studies in bone marrow chimeric mice demonstrated that the presence or absence of parenchymal Mrs2, rather than hematopoietic Mrs2, accounted for these differences. CPACC, a novel inhibitor of Mrs2, administered 2 hours prior to ischemia largely prevented ischemic kidney injury (Cr: CPACC 0.35+0.06 mg/dl vs saline 1.47+0.30, P=0.006, n=5). To explore the potential role of lactate in mediating these effects, we administered oxamate, an inhibitor of LDH, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, prior to ischemia.

In vitro studies showed that OX cells had higher cisplatin-induced cell death than wildtype (WT) cells. Furthermore, in a co-culture model in which both WT and OX cells were cultured together, OX cells had higher cisplatin-induced cell death. Conditioned media from cisplatin treated OX cells induced higher cell death compared to conditioned media from cisplatin treated WT cells. The higher cisplatin-induced cell death was associated with reduced mitochondrial function and increased mitochondrial ROS production. Assessment of mitochondria in kidneys showed a significant reduction in Drp1 levels in PANX1Tg kidneys compared to WT controls.

Inhibition of insulin secretion by thiazides was CO2/HCO3--dependent, not additive to unselective carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition with acetazolamide and independent of extracellular potassium. In contrast, insulin secretion was unaltered in islets of mice lacking the known molecular thiazide targets NCC (SLC12A3) or NDCBE (SLC4A8). CA expression profiling with subsequent knock-down of individual CA isoforms suggested mitochondrial CA5b as molecular target. In support of these findings, thiazides significantly attenuated Krebs cycle anaplerosis through reduction of mitochondrial oxalacetate synthesis. CA5b KO mice were resistant to thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, and insulin secretion of islets isolated from CA5b KO mice was unaffected by thiazides.", "Our study reveals attenuated insulin secretion due to inhibition of the mitochondrial CA5b isoform in \u03b2-cells as molecular mechanism of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance."], ["B lymphocytes play a critical role in developing autoimmunity in patients through antigen-presentation, cytokine release, and antibody production. Antigen stimulation of the cognate memory B cells triggers their rapid differentiation into plasma cells, producing massive amounts of pathogenic antibodies in a short period. In idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and IgG4-related disease, an early recovery of memory B cells in patients post-Rituximab therapy is the only reliable parameter that strongly predicts disease relapse. The phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) is the dominant autoantigen in primary membranous nephropathy (PMN), associated with ~80% of clinical cases. Considering that memory B cells are a heterogenous pool of antigen-experienced B cells, we developed a sensitive and reliable method to detect and quantify the PLA2R antigen-specific memory B cells (PLA2R-MB) in patients diagnosed with PLA2R-associated PMN.", "The PLA2R antigen was expressed in the HEK 293 cells and affinity purified. The purified antigens were then conjugated to a fluorochrome.

Importantly, patients with early signs of relapse, while possessing undetectable anti-PLA2R antibodies, showed at least a one-fold increase in the PLA2R-MB level. Moreover, patients with partial remission showed a sustained high level of PLA2R-MBs, which fluctuated with the immunosuppressive therapy.", "Our data indicate that the PLA2R antigen-specific memory B cell levels in patients have a substantial value in serving as a new biomarker to assess the patient response to immunosuppressive therapies for treatment adjustment and predict the pre-clinical signs of PMN relapse."], ["Apolipoprotein-L1 (APOL1) high-risk genotypes are associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people of African ancestry. APOL1 is endogenously expressed in the kidney by podocytes, and endothelial cells (ECs).

Utilizing two datasets of glomeruli from patients with nephrotic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, we identified an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and an enrichment in leukocyte migration pathways in patients carrying APOL1 high-risk genotypes. This signature of EC activation was confirmed by analyzing publicly available RNA-seq data from podocyte-specific APOL1 transgenic mice, which presented a 4,9 and 2,8-fold increase in VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, respectively. In both ECs derived from genetically modified iPSCs and primary human glomerular ECs we show that APOL1 expression induced EC activation in a non-phlogistic manner. Specifically, APOL1 overexpression promoted changes in adhesion molecules, endothelial junctional proteins, inflammatory receptors, and intracellular complexity leading to an increase in monocyte attachment.", "Overall, our data support the involvement of APOL1 as an inducer of EC activation and dysfunction, both in vivo and in vitro, in multiple vascular beds with effects beyond the glomerular vasculature."], ["Lipid-induced kidney injury is a highly relevant pathway in experimental models of glomerular disease (GD).

Urinary CD4+ T cells outperformed traditional biomarkers such as ANCA titers, hematuria, and proteinuria in renal flare prediction. Applying a cut-off of 490 CD4+ T cells per 100ml urine yielded a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 97.8% in identifying patients with future renal flares. A combination of urinary CD4+ T cells (>50/100ml) and PR3 ANCA levels (>40IU/ml) increased the predictive value to the sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92%.

In the field of digital pathology, AI can now serve as decision-support for pathologists, with the potential for gains in productivity and time-saving. It was demonstrated previously that AI can aid in identifying histopathological classes of renal diseases, e.g. of diabetic nephropathy. Although these models reach high prediction accuracies, their black box structure makes them very non-transparent. The disadvantage is that the networks\u2019 decisions are not easily interpretable by humans and it is not clear what information in the input data underlies their decisions.

Hematuria cases had higher systolic blood pressure, higher urine albumin:creatinine (uACR) ratios and lower eGFR compared to controls, supporting enrichment for hematuria due to glomerular pathologies. Although most GWAS analyze one trait at a time, many clinical syndromes are defined by combinations of outcomes. Therefore, generating a combined phenotype may improve power to detect loci influencing multiple traits.", "The composite outcome of hematuria and albuminuria was chosen to enrich for glomerular disease. We performed a case-control GWAS in the white British subset of the UK Biobank. Cases had both hematuria defined by ICD codes and albuminuria defined as uACR >3 mg/mmol.

Mutations in the CTNS gene lead to the loss of the cystinosin transporter, resulting in intralysosomal cystine accumulation. There is no curative treatment for cystinosis to date, therefore, we aim to develop a novel gene repair strategy for the most predominant 57 kb deletion of CTNS using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which allows for the delivery of a CTNS repair template into a specific location in the genome.", "For this study, we used two conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC): a cystinotic patient-derived and a CTNS -/- knock-out. For the delivery of the repair complex, we used a novel non-viral peptide-mediated delivery system. The repair construct for CTNS (3.2 kb) contains the CTNS promoter and the first 10 exons of the CTNS gene, as well as a fluorescent reporter gene (mCherry). Additionally, a second repair construct was designed (1.7 Kb), excluding the mCherry gene, to study a more therapeutic-like construct.", "After transfection of the repair construct, the large and small repair templates achieved 5% and 20% insertion efficiency (N=3), respectively, indicating that the cells had successfully inserted the repair template into their DNA. Further analysis of individual clonal cells showed restoration of lysosomal cystine levels in 60% of the clones transfected with the big template (3.2 Kb), showing cystine values between 1-2nmol/mg protein (N=12; p<0.001). Strikingly, more than 70% of the clones transfected with the therapeutic-like template (1.7 kb), which were blind sorted, show cystine values between 0.5-2nmol/mg protein (N=15; p<0.001) thus, indicating that in most of the cells the repair template was inserted, consequently restoring the CTNS function.", "In conclusion, these data show that the CTNS repair template can be precisely inserted into the genome, leading to the translation of a functional cystinosin transporter, which consequently restores the lysosomal cystine accumulation.

Yet, most of PC2 is localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and more permeable to K+ than Ca2+. In the cilia-centric view, ER-localized PC2 mainly facilitates ciliary targeting of PC1-PC2 complexes.", "The trimeric intracellular channel-B (TricB), aka TMEM38B, is an ER resident K+ channel that mediates K+-Ca2+ counterion exchange for inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release. Using TricB as experimental tool, we explored the function of ER-localized PC2 and its role in ADPKD pathogenesis by using cultured cells, zebrafish, and mouse models.", "ATP-induced ER Ca2+ release was defective in PC2-null renal epithelial cells, which was reversed by exogenous expression of TricB. Likewise, exogenous PC2 reversed ER Ca2+ release defect in TricB-null HEK293 cells. Microinjection of wildtype but not non-functional TricB mRNA into PC2-morphant zebrafish embryos ameliorated pronephric cysts. Similarly, ER targeting of ROMK K+ channel normally expresses on the plasma membrane suppressed the cystic phenotypes. R6G mutant of PC2 that fails to localize to cilia was still capable of reversing ER Ca2+ release defect in PC2-null cultured cells and PC2-deficient zebrafish phenotypes.

Ogt deletion in juvenile Pkd1 conditional knock-out mice reduced ciliary length, renal cystogenesis and kidney weight/body weight, improved kidney function, and increased survival of the mice. Similarly, OGT inhibition in cultured ADPKD patient renal epithelial cells shortened primary cilia and reduced in vitro cyst formation. Additionally, combined treatment of ADPKD cells with OGT and ciliogenesis inhibitors reduced cyst formation to a greater extent than treatment with either inhibitor alone. Co-immunoprecipitation data revealed that OGT interacts with intraflagellar transport protein IFT81, which is important for cilia synthesis and maintenance.", "O-GlcNAc is elevated in ADPKD kidneys, and its downregulation reduces ciliary length and renal cystogenesis.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant eukaryotic RNA chemical modification. Mettl3, an mRNA methyltransferase, mediates the m6A reaction by transferring an activated methyl group from s-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to adenosine. A major contributor of renal failure is low \u2018nephron endowment\u2019, which chiefly occurs due to defects in the self-renewal or the differentiation of the nephron progenitors (NPs). Here, we studied whether the methionine-RNA methylation pathway plays a role in the renewal and differentiation of NPs.", "We examined Mettl3 expression in the NP lineage of developing kidneys. We generated mice to conditionally ablate or overexpress Mettl3 in the NP lineage. We used a Mettl3-specific inhibitor or activator to pharmacologically modulate the m6A pathway in ex vivo kidney cultures and isolated primary NP cultures. We also tested whether methionine and SAM impact NP fate.", "We find that the Mettl3-m6A pathway expression is higher in differentiated NPs compared to renewing NPs. Six2/cre-mediated Mettl3 deletion blocks NP differentiation leading to the accumulation of renewing NPs and a markedly lower nephron count. In contrast, deleting Mettl3 subsequent to NP differentiation, using Wnt4/cre, has no impact on kidney development. Conversely, Six2/cre-mediated Mettl3 overexpression results in precocious and ectopic differentiation leading to the premature depletion of renewing NPs. Similarly, acute pharmacological Mettl3 inhibition or methionine depletion blocks NP differentiation whereas acute Mettl3 activation or higher SAM availability has an opposite effect in cultures. Moreover, methionine/SAM promotes Mettl3 expression in NPs, and regulates NP fate through Mettl3. Finally, subthreshold activity of the Mettl3-m6A pathway appears to induce both NP renewal and differentiation leading to enhanced nephrogenesis in ex vivo kidney cultures and in kidney organoids.", "Our work uncovers RNA methylation as a novel stem cell pathway in metanephros development and links methionine utilization to m6A chemical modification in NP fate commitment."], ["Despite many significant advances in understanding nephron segment patterning, numerous questions remain about the underlying genes and signaling pathways that orchestrate cell fate and regulate differentiation.

Changes in cell dynamics (e.g. cell death and proliferation) were also analyzed via immunofluorescence.", "Exogenous estrogen treatments revealed changes in distal segment composition. Interestingly, xenoestrogens ethinylestradiol and genistein yielded the same changes in distal segments. Upon treatment with an Esr2 antagonist, PHTPP, we observed the opposite phenotypes. Similarly, genetic knockdown of Esr2 analogs revealed phenotypes consistent with that of PHTPP treatment. Inhibition of E2 signaling also resulted in decreased expression of essential distal transcription factors.", "Taken together, these data suggest that estrogenic compounds are essential for distal segment fate during nephrogenesis, and add to our understanding of hormone function during kidney organogenesis.

In 3D culture, the spheres developed into UB organoids that exhibited branching morphogenesis and spatial organization comparable to the fetal UB. At later stages the UB organoids differentiated into CD organoids, which contained >95% CD cell types as estimated by scRNA-seq. Cells isolated from the organoids generated robust ENaC-mediated vectorial Na+ transport that was further induced by stimulation with mineralocorticoid signaling.

After the establishment of the renal neurovascular main branches, we observed subsequent interstitial branching by E17.5 as renal nerves grow until axonal projections reach their targets. Further, we uncovered that renal nerves synapse with the vasculature as early as E16.5, suggesting the establishment of functional crosstalk. We also observed synapses near glomeruli and tubules by E18.5. To assess functional roles for nerves during kidney development, we genetically ablated neurons innervating the kidney utilizing a TrkA knockout mouse.

This is a grey zone with no clear answers, consensus or treatment protocols. Renal parameter used to define AKI is creatinine (Cr). In AKI, Cr relates to glomerular function and does not represent true tubular injury. Is the AKI present on admission (CRS) or developed with the use of diuretics?\nIn patients that receive diuretics, elevation of Cr could be due to: i) Redistribution of fluid occurs within different body compartments. Increase in Cr is a reflection of changed hemodynamic and hormonal changes. ii) hypovolemia with prerenal state due to diuresis- as kidney sees less volume, it will increase reabsorption of Na, Urea, Uric acid, Creatinine, leading to elevated Cr and Bun. At this stage, there is no anatomic injury to the nephrons. iii) True AKI - either directly from long standing CRS or persistant hypovolemia from aggressive diuresis, ATN develops. Here, there is real damage to the tubules. It is a common myth that Lasix is nephrotoxic. In reality, Lasix is not Nephrotoxic. But why does the creatinine rise with diuretics? It is due to the hypovolemia, prerenal state caused by Lasix. Lasix does not cause direct toxic injury to the tubules.\niv) Acute GN- Patient has concomitant Glomerulo nephritis unrelated to CRS. v) ineffective diuresis due to hypoalbuminemia as albumin is the carrier for Lasix to the site of action in renal tubules. vi) Nephrotic syndrome- albumin in the tubules binds Lasix and effective circulatory Lasix is reduced. i-iii - not associated with true renal tubule damage.

The CVVHDF order was modified to target [Na] 125mEq/L in pre-filter fluid, dialysate, and post-filter fluid.\nH2O was added to each dialysate bag using the principle Concentration1(140mEq/L)*Volume1(5L)=Concentration2(125mEq/L)*Volume2(5.6L), yielding 600mL sterile H2O added to each 5L bag. S[Na] was 124mEq/L by CVVHDF day 2. That day [Na] in dialysate was kept constant because of a transient S[Na] increase the day prior. CVVHDF day 3, H2O added to dialysate was reduced to target dialysate [Na] 130mEq/L, and on CVVHDF day 4 was reduced again to target [Na] 135mEq/L. CVVHDF days 5+, standard dialysate with [Na] 140mEq/L was used. S[Na] increased to 128mEq/L 24hr after S[Na] 116mEq/L, likely due to administration of hypertonic saline. 18h later, after about 30h CVVHDF, 12h with [Na] 140mEq/L bath, 18h with [Na] 125mEq/L bath, S[Na] was 124mEq/L. S[Na] increased roughly linearly to 136mEq/L 5 days after measurement of S[Na] 116mEq/L. After correction of 12mEq/L in the first 24h with concurrent hypertonic saline administration, rate of correction never exceeded 7mEq/L/day. The patient was discharged without liver transplant, on HD, and showed no signs of ODS.", "Changing the target [Na] in CVVHDF solutions is a more precise method for gradually increasing S[Na] than administering D5W intravenously at high rate during CVVHDF, and adjusting D5W rate according to frequent S[Na] measurments. Adding more than 600mL sterile H2O to each 5L bag was not attempted. The maximum amount of H2O that can be added is unknown."], ["The most common abnormality of mineral bone disease seen in ESRD is renal osteodystrophy.

Neither patients experienced hypocalcemia as a side effect.", "Immobilization related hypercalcemia occurs when osteoclastic bone resorption exceeds osteoblastic bone formation causing an imbalance in the bone remodeling process. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits RANKL reducing osteoclast maturation and bone resorption. Both our patients were not on any drugs that could cause hypercalcemia and had no evidence of underlying granulomatous disease. Although PTHrP was mildly elevated in both patients, it was attributed to ESRD itself and we hypothesize that hypercalcemia was due to prolonged immobilization. Intravenous hydration is an unsafe option in ESRD. HD using low Ca dialysate is an option, but both patients were resistant to this. Both patients had improvement in Ca levels with denosumab and neither experienced hypocalcemia as a side effect probably due to ongoing hemodialysis. Case reports describe patients with ESRD and hypercalcemia who were successfully treated with denosumab. It offers advantages compared to bisphosphonates with its rapid onset, longer action and no dose adjustment for kidney function.

The patient was detected with mild hypokalemia, NAGMA and a urine pH of 7 since 7 years ago when having pyelonephritis, indicating distal RTA. Her distal RTA could be multifactorial. Vitamin D deficiency might be a factor but her normal serum calcium level does not support it. Her HIV and Biktarvy (has Tenofovir) usage are unlikely the main contributors as her hypokalemia happened much earlier than the HIV history.
