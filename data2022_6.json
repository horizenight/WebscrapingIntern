Contrasted computed tomography (CT) revealed severe coarctation of the aorta (COA) with minimal patent lumen. No renin-secreting tumor or renal artery stenosis was identified. Severe COA was confirmed by invasive aortography.", "This case describes an association between severe COA, extreme plasma renin elevation and hypertension. The mechanism behind renin elevation in this situation is unclear. In addition to severe COA with minimal patent lumen and elevated pressure gradients across the coarcted segment identified by CT angiography and invasive aortography, findings such as \u201cdampened upstroke\u201d by renal arterial doppler and moderately-to-severely reduced ankle-brachial indices suggest that renal hypoperfusion may play a role. Use of the angiotensin II receptor blocker azilsartan to control hypertension likely contributed to some degree of plasma renin elevation and relatively suppressed serum aldosterone. It is also notable that plasma renin remained extremely elevated despite concomitant use of metoprolol. Hypertension was reasonably controlled medically, but the patient ultimately underwent coarctation repair of hemodynamically significant, severe COA."], ["Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are a group of specialized vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells but distinguished from VSM cells by the synthesis and secretion of renin. However, the intracellular mechanisms of renin release from JG remain elusive.", "We performed single-cell RNA seq on a total of 9815 cells that were derived from renal cortex tissue of C57BL/6J mice.", "Unbiased clustering analysis demonstrated 12 distinct cell clusters. In particular, a cluster consisting of 284 cells was identified as VSM cells by distinct expression of Acta2 (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin). Moreover, based on the co-expression of Ren1 (renin), 34 JG cells were further distinguished from this cluster of VSM cells. We profiled the transcriptome of these JG cells and correlated it with Ren1. The top 5 genes that were most positively correlated with Ren1 expression were Nr2f1, Akr1b7, Smim15, Gng11, and Sdc1. We also compared the transcriptome between JG cells and VSM cells. The top 5 genes that were most differentially expressed in JG cells vs. VSM cells were Ren1, Sfrp2, Akr1b7, Fam46a, and Sdc1. Thus, Akr1b7 and Sdc1 could be potential candidate genes that participate in the control of Ren1 expression in JG cells. In the present study, we examined the role of Sdc1 (syndecan-1) in the regulation of renin synthesis and secretion in response to perfusion pressure changes with both in vitro model of isolated/perfused afferent arteriole (Af-Art) and in vivo model of 2 kidneys 1 clip (2K1C). We found that low perfusion pressure through Af-Art increased Ren1 mRNA expression by 140.7\u00b124.8% while high perfusion pressure decreased the expression by 66.2\u00b113.1% compared to normal perfusion pressure in WT mice. However, the perfusion pressure alteration-induced changes in Ren1 expression were significantly attenuated in SDC1KO mice (n=4-5; p<0.05). Additionally, 2K1C increased renin expression in low-pressure kidney by 163.3\u00b148.7%, plasma renin and Ang II concentrations by 118.2\u00b161.4% and 162.8\u00b150.2%, and mean arterial pressure by 31.6\u00b15.7 mmHg. However, the 2K1C-induced changes were significantly reduced in SDC1KO mice (n=5-7; p<0.01).", "In conclusion, this study demonstrates that syndecan-1 is a key mechano-sensor in JG cells that regulates the renin synthesis and secretion."], ["Renal artery dissection is frequently seen as an extension of aortic dissection, but bilateral Spontaneous Renal Artery Dissection (SRAD) is an extremely rare condition that has only been described in case reports.

The pathogenesis of hypertension in metabolic syndrome remains speculative. Americans are consuming >300 calories/day of sugar- mostly in the form of fructose and sucrose (a glucose/fructose disaccharide). In addition, Americans are consuming 2-3 times the recommended amount of salt. How the interaction between excessive salt, carbohydrates, and their transporters in the small intestine may lead to salt sensitivity of hypertension in metabolic syndrome remains unknown.\nIncreased consumption of sucrose (which hydrolyzes to glucose and fructose) increases systemic blood pressure in rodents. There are distinct pathways mediating the absorption of glucose vs. fructose in the small intestine.

Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression did not change in glucose- or fructose-fed mice. In addition, the expression of SGK1, which regulates the expression of NHE3 and SGLT1 was increased significantly in glucose-fed, but not fructose-fed mice. The expression of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2), which inactivates glucocorticoids, is decreased in glucose-fed mice, which ensures that glucocorticoids remain active and can efficiently compete for binding with MR. GLUT5 was increased more significantly in fructose-fed, whereas SGLT1 was increased more significantly in glucose-fed mice.", "Our studies demonstrate that increased glucose consumption activates the MR and SGK1, but downregulates 11\u03b2-HSD2 in the small intestine. The upregulation of MR and SGK1 can facilitate further salt absorption via NHE3 and SGLT1 working in parallel and stimulated by glucocorticoids.

Since glycolysis induction will lead to lactate accumulation and acidosis in kidney, we further explored whether the decreased intracellular pH can suppress wound healing and kidney repair.", "In vitro in cultured renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) with hypoxia treatment, when intracellular lactate accumulation was induced by \u03b1-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CyA), there was significant intracellular pH decrease, which was partially reversed by glycolysis inhibition (shikonin to inhibit PKM2) or NH4Cl to enhance intracellular pH. Concurrently, the scratched wound was healed much slower with CyA, accompanied with b-catenin increase. Either shikonin or NH4Cl improved the wound healing speed with declined b-catenin. The delayed wound healing by CyA treatment was significantly enhanced if b-catenin was knockdown. In mice, the lactate was significantly accumulated after UI30/2wk in wild type kidney, which was relieved by PKM2 knockout. The accumulation of lactate in wild type kidneys after UI30/2wk was associated with b-catenin induction but less significant in PKM2 knockout kidneys. When renal acidosis was reduced by NaHCO3 treatment at 4 days after kidney ischemia, the mice showed better renal function and significantly more intact renal proximal tubules in kidney after 2-week reperfusion.", "Altogether, the enhanced glycolysis after acute kidney injury may intracellular pH decrease with lactate accumulation, which will further suppress renal repair, potentially through the induction of b-catenin."], ["Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and microRNAs, regulate maladaptive kidney repair including renal fibrosis. By global sequencing, we identified the hypermethylation of microRNA-219-2 (mir-219) gene in unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO), 25 minutes of bilateral renal ischemia with 1 week reperfusion injury (I25/1wk), and 25 minutes of bilateral renal ischemia with 1month reperfusion injury (I25/1M). mir-219 hypermethylation was further confirmed by pyro-sequencing. The hypermethylation was associated with downregulation of mir-219. Functionally, mir-219 overexpression enhanced fibronectin expression in cultured renal cells during hypoxia or TGF-b1 treatment. In mice, inhibition of mir-219 with anti-mir-219 LNA suppressed fibronectin accumulation in UUO kidneys.", "To understand how mir-219 regulates fibronectin expression, we performed RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC, the complex for microRNA to bind to its target) immunoprecipitation, followed by RNA-seq to identify the potential targets of mir-219.", "The potential candidate targets of mir-219 were further narrowed down to 5 (CANX, ALDH1L2, SMG1, NR2C2, CRTC1) after examination of the existence of predicted mir-219 binding sites in the seed sequence of the mRNAs accumulated in RISC, the conservation of the predicted mir-219 binding sites between species (in both human and mouse), and the reported expression level of the proteins in kidney. By screening the protein expression of these candidates, we found that mir-219 overexpression significantly suppressed ALDH1L2 in renal cells. In mice, mir-219 inhibition preserved ALDH1L2 expression in ureter obstructed kidneys. The functional binding site of mir-219 in the 3\u2019-UTR of ALDH1L2 mRNA was further confirmed by luciferase assay. When ALDH1L2 was knockdown by siRNAs, obviously more fibronectin was induced in renal cells during TGF-b1 treatment.", "In conclusion, mir-219-2 gene hypermethylation may suppress mir-219 expression.

After tamoxifen-induced Cre induction, mice were subjected to bilateral ischemia/reperfusion (BIRI), or aristolochic acid (AA)-induced fibrosis. The deletion of Brca1 exon 11 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Markers of DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and senescence were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. Kidney tissue lysates were evaluated using western blot, real-time PCR, and PicroSirius (PS) Red staining and markers of DNA damage, senescence, and interstitial fibrosis.

In addition, CCR6/CCL20 expressions in kidney tissues of patients with CKD were assessed.", "In both animal models, the expression of CCL20 increased as inflammation and fibrosis increased. Therefore, a positive correlation was observed for CCL20 in fibrosis. Furthermore, CCL20 blockade in human tubular epithelial cells ameliorated apoptotic damage in a dose-dependent manner on hypoxia and ROS injury. Interestingly, the CCL20 blockade led to a more significant reduction of intracellular ROS, 8-OHDG, and ICAM-1 level. uIRI provoked CCR6 expression that showed a similar severity as patients with acute kidney disease (AKD) phenotype. We analyzed CCR6/CCL20 expression from 22/18/16 patients with CKD stages 1-2/3/4-5, respectively.

These studies also indicated that tubulointerstitial injury and inflammation occur secondary to glomerular injury, whereas human studies suggested a direct effect of HIV on tubular cells. In vitro studies demonstrated a salient role of Vpr on tubular injury, where Vpr induces DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest, and cytokinesis defects, resulting in apoptosis and polyploidy in a majority of cells and hyperproliferation in small subsets.

The presence of CHIP has been associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease. We tested whether CHIP is a novel risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) in two community-based cohorts.", "We evaluated participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Community (ARIC; N = 10,570) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; N = 2,792). We identified somatic DNA mutations in peripheral leukocytes that met established criteria for CHIP using whole exome and whole genome data. AKI events were previously ascertained in both cohorts based on hospitalization codes with additional validation by manual chart review in CHS. We used proportional hazards regression to test associations of CHIP with AKI after adjustment for relevant confounders.", "CHIP was identified in 7.6% of ARIC participants (median age: 58) and 14.5% of CHS participants (median age: 72). The incidence rate of AKI was higher among persons with CHIP in both cohorts: 12.6 vs. 10.4 events per 1000 person-years in ARIC and 6.6 vs. 4.4 events per 1000 person-years in CHS. In a fixed-effects meta-analysis adjusted for age, age2, sex, and baseline eGFR, the presence of CHIP was associated with an estimated 18% greater risk of AKI (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02 \u2013 1.37). The risk for AKI was greatest for mutations in driver genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP; HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07 \u2013 1.55).", "CHIP is associated with a greater risk of incident AKI in two large community-based cohorts. Non-DNMT3A CHIP mutations demonstrate the strongest associations with incident AKI. CHIP may therefore be a novel risk factor for AKI that could partially explain the strong age dependency of this condition. Future studies will elucidate which subtypes of CHIP pose the highest risk of kidney sequelae and in which scenarios emerging treatments for CHIP would be beneficial."], ["Genetic studies have focused on associations between genetic variants and the risk for AKI compared to controls, but this framework may be limited because AKI is highly heterogeneous. We hypothesized that a GWAS for distinct AKI recovery patterns (resolving versus non-resolving AKI) would identify novel and robust genetic risks for AKI.", "We included 2,271 patients with AKI previously enrolled in three different studies of hospitalized patients (ASSESS-AKI, iSPAAR and HMC Trauma). Resolving AKI was a \u2265 0.3 mg/dL or \u2265 25% decrease in serum creatinine within the first 72 hours after AKI onset (n=1524) and non-resolving AKI was the absence of resolving (n=747). Array-based genome-wide genotypes were obtained from each dataset and imputed with Haplotype Reference Consortium v r1.1. We pooled results from all three studies and used an additive genetic model adjusting for site, age, sex, and the first 10 principal components (significance was p<5x10 -8).", "We identified one variant (rs263152, C>T, frequency 29%) on chromosome 6 that achieved genome-wide significance with the T allele associated with a greater risk of non-resolving AKI (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.28-1.68, p=4.28x10-8) (Figure 1). rs263152 is intronic to LOC153910, a long non-coding RNA. In each cohort, the minor allele of rs263152 was consistently associated with a greater risk of non-resolving AKI. Query of the NephQTL database revealed that rs263152 is a cis eQTL for AIG1 (Androgen Induced Gene-1) in tubulointerstitial cells (p=0.007). AIG1 has been implicated in albuminuria in the Framingham Heart Study.", "Identification of genetic risks for AKI may be facilitated by a focus on less heterogeneous sub-phenotypes, such as non-resolving AKI. Our findings suggest that genetic variation that alters expression of AIG1 confers greater risk of non-resolving AKI.", ""], ["Mitochondria are necessary for recovery from ischemia-reperfusion injury due to their critical roles in oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) is an indirect marker of mitochondrial abundance that has been used to quantify the number of mitochondrial genomes per cell. Prior epidemiologic studies have associated higher blood mtDNA-CN with reduced risks of chronic kidney disease and mortality, but to our knowledge no study has examined risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).", "Among 628 adults undergoing cardiac surgery, mtDNA-CN was quantified in pre-operative blood buffy coat specimens using multiplexed SYBR Green-based qPCR. AKI was defined as >50% increase in serum creatinine or need for dialysis following surgery. Subclinical AKI was defined by the highest quintiles of urine interleukin-18 (IL-18), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and chitinase-3-like-protein-1 (YKL-40) on the first post-operative day among those without clinical AKI. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations of mtDNA-CN with clinical and subclinical AKI.", "The mean age was 73\u00b19 years and mean pre-operative eGFR was 72\u00b118 ml/min/1.73m2. Each SD higher mtDNA-CN was associated with about a 38% lower risk of AKI (Table) in both unadjusted and multivariable adjusted models. There were no significant associations of mtDNA-CN with subclinical AKI, as defined by urinary levels of IL-18, KIM-1, MCP-1, or YKL-40.", "Among adults undergoing cardiac surgery, higher pre-operative mtDNA-CN was associated with reduced risk of AKI but not with urinary biomarkers of tubular injury. MtDNA-CN may reflect kidney energetic reserve that promotes defense against acute ischemic stress.", ""], ["Oral anticoagulant therapy may be associated with kidney complications. Emerging evidence from observational studies suggest lower risks associated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared to vitamin K-antagonists (VKAs). However, these studies suffer from methodological limitations, which we aimed to address using the unique Danish setting of population-based medical databases.", "We conducted a new user active comparator cohort study in patients who started oral anticoagulant drug use within three months after an incident atrial fibrillation diagnosis during 2012 to 2018. Using routinely collected creatinine measurements from laboratory databases, we followed patients in an intension-to-treat approach for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. AKI was defined according to the KDIGO criteria; CKD progression was a composite of >30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or kidney failure. Propensity-score weighting was used to balance baseline confounders; we reported weighted absolute risks using the Aalen-Johansen estimator and weighted hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression. Consistency was checked within prespecified subgroups.", "We included 33,670 persons with atrial fibrillation initiating oral anticoagulation with 77% in the DOAC cohort. The median age was 75 years, 48% were women, and 25% had a baseline eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The median follow-up was 2.3 years. Absolute risks of kidney complications were high: During the first year of treatment the cumulative risk of AKI was 13.9% in the DOAC group and 15.5% in the VKA group; the 5-year risk of CKD progression was 14.0% in DOAC users and 15.4% in VKA users. Compared to VKA initiation, DOAC treated patients had lower rates of both AKI and CKD progression with HRs of 0.85 (95% CI [0.81; 0.89]) and 0.84 (95% CI [0.78; 0.91]) respectively. Results were similar across subgroups of age, sex, baseline eGFR, and diabetes.", "Kidney complications were common among atrial fibrillation patients initiating oral anticoagulant drugs.

Baby NINJA (Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by Just-in-time Action) is a screening process aimed to reduce NTM exposure and AKI in the neonatal intensive care unit, but requires daily serum creatinine (sCr) screening. Urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) has been associated with AKI and offers a less invasive screening mechanism.", "This single center study observed use of an alternative pathway for daily screening following patient triggering of Baby NINJA starting June 2021. Following triggering, providers were prompted daily for selection of sCr or uNGAL monitoring. If uNGAL was >150 ng/mL, screening was transitioned to daily sCr only. Screening compliance was tracked for quality metrics and calculated by daily sCr or uNGAL obtained divided by NTM exposure days plus 2 days. Process control methods determined trends from baseline. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U Test.", "Daily screening compliance increased following implementation of the alternative pathway (pre 78% vs. post 84%, p= 0.006)(Figure 1). 37% of screening occurred by uNGAL with conversion to daily sCr in 21%(21/99) of new exposures. Rates of high NTM exposure per 1000 patient days decreased (8% to 5%, p=0.0002). AKI rates did not differ between pre and post implementation eras. Median uNGAL that triggered conversion was 263 ng/mL (IQR 195-825 ng/mL). Median birth gestational age of those that converted was 30 wks (IQR 25-35 wks). Following implementation, 7 subjects experienced a total of 16 days of AKI. 5 patients had AKI at the time of baby NINJA trigger and continued with daily SCr, while 2 patients uNGALs triggered conversion (859 & 2835 ng/mL). Of the 7 patients with AKI, 4 experienced death within 48 hours of trigger.
