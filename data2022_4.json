The IVM images were processed to automatically derive the number of identified intersecting points, to quantify microcirculatory blood flow and observe the change in perfusion index at each timepoint. Blood samples were collected at the same timepoints corresponding to the IVM image acquisitions to measure syn1 and quantify glycocalyx shedding during HD. Continuous BP recordings were made from carotid artery cannulation.", "BP response to HD was comparable between the two groups.

Ultrastructural analysis showed proximal tubule apical and basolateral vacuolization. A review of medical literature identified 7 previous cases of RTA associated with PD-1 therapy. Urine pH was 6.0 in 3, 6.3 in one, 6.5 in two, and 6.7 in one case.", "This case represents a novel form of RTA, which we term Type V RTA. Type II (proximal) RTA is excluded given the persistent urine acidification during alkali therapy and undetectable urinary citrate. Intact urine acidification excludes Type I (distal) RTA. The absence of hyperkalemia excludes Type IV (hyperkalemic) RTA. Instead, we postulate that this case represents a novel form of RTA, Type V RTA, which is characterized by normal gap metabolic acidosis, impaired ammonia excretion despite intact urine acidification, the absence of hyperkalemia, and intact ability to decrease urinary citrate. A case review identifies several similar cases, all associated with anti-PD1 therapy. We suggest the etiology is impaired proximal tubule ammonia generation, which may be related to the proximal tubule vacuolization observed."], ["Patients with insulin resistance such as with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are on oral contraceptives (OCPs) and antipsychotics, may be at an increased risk for hypertriglyceridemia as a side effect. Lipolysis of triglycerides may increase free fatty acid production and therefore contribute to HAGMA. When there is severe hypertriglyceridemia, then plasmapheresis and dialysis play an important role in resolution.", "An 18 year old female with a past medical history of PCOS, diabetes, and depression presented to the ED with lower abdominal pain. Her home medications included lurasidone, sertraline, ethinyl estradiol-norgestimate, metformin, and insulin. Patient complained of associated dysuria. In the ED patient was found with tachycardia and tachypnea, but normotensive and afebrile. Labs were notable for leukocytosis of 15.7, glucose 252, bicarb 6, anion gap 23, and sodium 128. BUN was 4 and creatinine was 0.6. There was not a significant osmolality gap. Lactic acid was not elevated. Acetaminophen, ethanol, and salicylate levels were negative. UA was significant for leukocyte esterase, protein, glucose, and ketones. Urine culture grew E coli. Blood gas on room air showed pH of 7.028, pCo2 10.3, bicarb 5, and paO2 130. Lipid panel showed cholesterol of 1,062, LDL < 472, and triglycerides > 2625. Lipase was 431, without findings of pancreatic pathology on CT abdomen. Hemoglobin A1C was found to be 9.81. The patient received a dialysis and plasmapheresis session. She was started on insulin drip, statin, omega and fenofibrate. She received 5 amps of bicarb and was started on a bicarb drip. She was given a course of antibiotics for her UTI. Over a course of 24 hours the acidosis resolved and the anion gap closed. Triglycerides reduced to the 400s by the next day. Trialysis catheter was removed. Psychiatry and internal medicine decided to discontinue antipsychotic and continue sertraline. She was discharged with OCP containing less estrogen, insulin, statin, omega-3 and fenofibrate.", "In patients with hypermetabolic syndrome who have HAGMA on labs, it is important to check for elevated triglycerides and treat based on severity. After plasmapharesis and hemodialysis with reduction of triglyceride levels, our patient's HAGMA resolved. There have been a few cases reported of oral contraception-induced hypertriglyceridemia particularly with estrogen, but requires further research."], ["MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) is a rare disorder of mitochondrial DNA manifesting across multiple body systems, including with episodic lactic acidosis. Primary treatment of flares is with L-arginine. This medication has been shown to inhibit proximal renal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption, and we present a complicated case of this known but rare side effect.", "Our patient was a 40 year old male with a history of MELAS syndrome with subsequent seizures, hearing and visual loss, and previous stoke-like episodes; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with Empagliflozin. He presented to the hospital with 2-3 days of abdominal pain and malaise, with acute onset encephalopathy. Initial workup revealed an anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA), with evidence of lactic acidosis and DKA, and concurrent respiratory acidosis. He initially responded to IV fluids, insulin infusion, and mechanical ventillation. On hospital day 2 he was started on IV L-Arginine for suspected MELAS flare. The next day there was recurrence of AGMA, with additional non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA). AGMA, attributed to recurrence of euglycemic DKA vs. starvation ketosis, resolved with additional IV fluids and insulin infusion. Given the timeline, and urine labs consistent with type II renal tubular acidosis, his Arginine infusions were felt to be the most likely culprit for his NAGMA. He was treated with temporary bicarbonate supplementation, and with completion of his course of L-Arginine his acidosis resolved.", "This is a case of L-arginine induced non anion gap metabolic acidosis in a patient with MELAS syndrome. Although there have been occasional reports of this phenomenon, there is very little literature on this topic. This patient's case was also complicated by multiple other sources of metabolic, and respiratory, acidosis. Patients with MELAS syndrome are prone to complicated acid-base disturbances by nature of their disease. NAGMA from L-arginine is a medication side effect peculiar to this combination of therapy and disease process. Because of the multiple potential pitfalls in diagnosis illustrated by this case, it is important to bear this in mind when caring for patients with this rare disease."], ["High anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) is a common clinical scenario and often presents as a diagnostic challenge. We present an often-overlooked etiology of HAGMA in a hospitalised patient.", "A 65-year-old-female with atrophic right kidney and hypertension was referred to our hospital for management of a recently diagnosed urothelial bladder malignancy. She had multiple hospitalisations for urosepsis in the past 3 months. Labs showed low serum albumin of 2.3 mg/dl and serum creatinine of 0.65 mg/dl at the time of current admission. She underwent radical cystectomy and open right nephroureterectomy (for recurrent urosepsis). Post operatively she developed ileus and was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).\n\nOne week later, she developed progressively worsening HAGMA. Initial evaluation at the onset of acidosis showed high blood glucose with normal serum beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level. Insulin infusion was started and TPN was held. Despite giving sodium bicarbonate, HAGMA continued to worsen with decline in serum bicarbonate up to 10 mEq/l and increase in anion gap (AG) to 36 mEq/l by post operative day 17.\n\nSerum lactate was normal and there was no exposure to salicylates or alcohol. Serum creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl indicating mild acute kidney injury. Chart review showed a cumulative exposure of 49.7 grams to Acetaminophen over 19 days after the surgery. Urine 5-oxoproline was ordered and it was elevated at 1401 mmol/mol of creatinine. Liver function tests remained normal. Acetaminophen was held and intravenous N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) was given for a total dose of 300 mg/kg over one day. Serum AG normalized after 3 days of NAC to 12 mEq/L and bicarbonate improved to 23 mEq/L after one week.", "This case highlights 5-oxoprolinemia as a differential for HAGMA in a hospitalized patient with chronic acetaminophen exposure. Exposure to high cumulative doses of acetaminophen in patients with predisposing factors (elderly, females, malnutrition, sepsis, chronic acetaminophen exposure) should raise concern for this condition."]], "funding_list": ["", "NIDDK Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Private Foundation Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "NIDDK Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Commercial Support", "Commercial Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Commercial Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "NIDDK Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Commercial Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Private Foundation Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Other U.S. Government Support", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
