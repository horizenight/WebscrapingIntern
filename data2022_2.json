immunosuppressive drug that further improves the current prognosis has not yet been developed. Several recent studies have shown that bisphosphonate (BPP) use was associated with a favorable graft outcome in patients with KT. Therefore, we investigated whether the association between tacrolimus and graft outcome was different according to the use of BPP in patients with KT.", "This retrospective study was conducted by analyzing 1,657 patients who underwent KT at Severance Hospital in South Korea between January 2006 and December 2020. Patients with preoperative BPP use, cyclosporine use, rapamycin use, re-transplantation, and missing information were excluded. Primary exposure was time-dependent cross-product term of tacrolimus trough level (low TAC vs. normal-high TAC with reference of 4ng/mL) and BPP use. Primary outcome was graft failure defined as patient\u2019s death or conversion to kidney replacement therapy. Sensitivity analysis was performed with outcome of eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m<span style=\"font-size:10.8333px\">2</span>", "Among 1,657 patients, 362 (21.8%) patients were BPP user. During the 11211.8 person-year, graft outcomes occurred in 183 (11.0%) patients. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, normal-high TAC without BPP was associated with a lower risk of graft outcome (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.29-0.54]) compared to low TAC without BPP. Normal-high TAC with BPP was associated with a further lower risk of graft outcome (HR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.09-0.31]) compared to low TAC without BPP. Low TAC with BPP was also associated with a lower risk of graft outcome (HR, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.06-0.36]) compared to low TAC without BPP. This association was maintained in analyses using tacrolimus trough level of 5 or 6 ng/mL as reference. In addition, similar results were observed with outcome of eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m<span style=\"font-size:10.8333px\">2</span>", "The use of BPP was associated with favorable graft outcomes even in lower tacrolimus trough level. The addition of BPP to the conventional immunosuppressant regimen may reduce tacrolimus requirement."], ["Vitamin D [25(OH)D] insufficiency and FGF-23 elevation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is usually ameliorated after kidney transplantation (KT). However, post-transplant vitamin D insufficiency are still associated with poor graft outcome. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pretransplant FGF-23 level on post-transplant vitamin D status and clinical outcomes.", "The KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Kidney Transplantation (KNOW-KT) is a multicenter, observational cohort study. Four hundred subjects for whom serum FGF-23 measurement was available, were included in this study. Annual serum 25(OH)D and clinical outcomes; all-cause mortality, cardiovascular event, graft survival, and fracture were assessed according to baseline FGF-23 levels.", "Median follow-up duration was 6.5 years. Serum 25(OH)D3 levels were increased after KT (before KT, 12.6\u00b17.4; 1 year after KT, 22.6\u00b16.4; 3 years after KT, 24.3\u00b15.8 ng/mL). However, they were declined to 20.9\u00b19.2 ng/mL at 7 years after KT. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 79.1% just before KT, then it was decreased to 30.8% at 3 years after KT, whereas it was increased 37.8% at 6 years after KT. Serum FGF-23 level was decreased after KT [2140.6 (391-9277) pg/ml before KT vs. 50.0 (23.6-94.6) pg/ml at 3 years after KT, P=0.001]. The FGF-23 showed negative correlation with serum vitamin D levels. When we categorized subjects into tertile according to baseline GFG-23 level (low, middle, high FGF-23 groups), the 25(OH)D3 in the low baseline FGF-23 group was lowest at any point during follow-up. High baseline FGF-23 level was a risk factor for poor graft survival (HR 5.882, 95% C.I.; 1.443-23.976, P=0.022).", "Increased FGF-23 could interfere vitamin D activation even after KT and is a risk factor for poor graft survival."], ["Development of delayed graft function (DGF) has been associated with worse short and long-term outcomes after kidney transplantation (KT). Inflammation plays a key role in the development of DGF. The neutrophil to lymphocyte and platelet (NLP) ratio is an affordable biomarker of systemic inflammation easily determined from a complete blood cell count. We aimed to assess whether postoperative NLP ratio may be used as an early predictor of DGF in KT patients.", "We conducted a retrospective cohort of adult patients submitted to KT at our unit, between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2020. NLP was calculated at 24h post-KT. Primary outcome was development of DGF. Logistic regression was calculated to determine significant factors which may have contributed to DGF.", "We included 527 patients with a mean age of 49.9 \u00b1 12.8 years and the majority were male (n=308, 58.4%). Patients had been under renal replacement therapy for 5.9\u00b14 years. In 47.8% of patients expanded criteria donors were used, and in 3.6% non-heart-beating donors. DGF occurred in 17.8% of patients. Use of rabbit anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin for induction therapy was similar between groups (DGF vs. early graft function, p=0.078). Mean post-KT NLP was 26.4\u00b13.5 and, as expected, was higher in patients submitted to induction therapy with lymphocyte depleting antibodies (50.2\u00b140.3 vs. 11.9\u00b17.4 in patients treated with basiliximab, p<0.001), but it was found to be higher even before KT (and thereby before induction therapy) (5.2\u00b11.8 in patients treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin vs. 1.9\u00b11.2 with basiliximab, p=0.001) and not predictive of DGF.

Creatinine at discharge (3.3\u00b12.2 versus 1.4\u00b10.5, p=0.000) was higher in patients with DGF.", "In our cohort, a higher NLP ratio at 24 hours after KT was an independent predictor of DGF.

The Uox-iKO male animals also showed significant increases in urinary lactate excretion after induction of Uox KO. Here, we focused on the role of renal urate handling in controlling lactate secretion and mitochondrial function in human renal epithelial cells. Lactate is a substrate of URAT1 (SLC22A12) moving in trans with the apical entry of urate from the renal tubule lumen. We hypothesized that increased extracellular urate will promote the secretion of lactate via URAT1 and alter cellular respiration and mitochondrial function.", "Using cultured primary normal human cortical renal epithelial cells (NHCRE) we measured the effect of chronic extracellular urate on intracellular lactate and oxygen consumption rate using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer.", "In NHCRE cells we found that chronic exposure to increased extracellular urate (500\u03bcM from 24hrs to 2 weeks) significantly lowered intracellular lactate in the presence of either high (4.5g/l) or reduced glucose (1g/l), and that additional extracellular lactate rescued intracellular levels. Further, the application of probenecid, a general anion transporter blocker with affinity for URAT1, or verinurad, a specific URAT1 inhibitor, abolished the effects of extracellular urate on lactate levels, though URAT1 inhibition alone had no effect. Next, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR, normalized to cell number) in NHCRE cells using the Seahorse analyzer. We found chronic exposure to increased extracellular urate (500\u03bcM for 24 hours) significantly increased basal respiration and the maximum respiratory capacity. Both effects were abolished in the presence 0.5\u03bcM of verinurad.", "We conclude that increased tubular urate alters intracellular lactate levels and mitochondrial function in a URAT1 dependent manner, providing mechanistic evidence that urate alters cell metabolism in the proximal tubule and may contribute to kidney disease progression."], ["Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a tremendous socioeconomic burden in addition to increasing rates of morbidity and mortality, and several East Asian countries have a much higher prevalence of CKD compared to the global average.

However, despite the high prevalence of the ALDH2 polymorphism and of CKD among East Asian populations, little is known about the role of ALDH2 in CKD.", "ALDH2 expression patterns in kidney tissue were determined via immunohistochemical staining of mouse kidneys and human kidney biopsy samples. To explore the role of ALDH2 in CKD, ALDH2 expression was studied in vivo using an aristolochic acid-induced CKD mouse model and in vitro via human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). RPTECs were further utilized and cultured with the profibrotic protein TGF-\u03b2 to investigate the role of ALDH2 in kidney fibrosis.", "ALDH2 was highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules of healthy human and mouse kidneys. ALDH2 expression was significantly downregulated in CKD patients and inversely correlated with the severity of CKD, in human and mouse studies. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that a deficiency in ALDH2 expression was associated with kidney fibrosis in vitro, due to the role of ALDH2 protein in modulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.", "ALDH2 has a specific and localized expression pattern in the kidneys, and a deficiency in ALDH2 expression is linked to kidney fibrosis.

There is no practice standard for how to care for patients who survive an episode of AKI after hospitalization. Thus, the workgroup conducted two focus groups to understand current practices and gaps in care after an episode of AKI.\n\nTwo focus groups were held, one dedicated to care of patients who required outpatient dialysis for AKI (AKI-D) and one for those who developed AKI but did not require outpatient dialysis (AKI non-D). Diverse stakeholders were included: nephrologists, intensivists, nurses, pharmacists, administrators, patients who survived AKI and their care partners. Focus groups addressed facilitators and barriers to AKI follow-up, approaches to health care delivery (by whom, when, and how), and evidence-based practices that could improve patient outcomes. Detailed notes were taken and core concepts were summarized.\n\nCore findings from the AKI-D focus group were that there were several barriers to optimal post-AKI care: 1) heterogeneity in the definition of kidney recovery, 2) lack of evidence on who will achieve kidney recovery, 3) lack of guidance on how to monitor kidney recovery in dialysis units, and 5) suboptimal transition of care plans. In the AKI non-D group, high variability in care delivered after hospital discharge was the core theme identified. Patients with AKI were followed up by primary care, nephrology or other specialties, and using different modalities (in-person versus telehealth). In terms of potential interventions to improve patient outcomes there was consensus on the need to resume or initiate therapies including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors after AKI recovery, but the timing of this intervention was variable. Participants emphasized the role of physical and cognitive rehabilitation as an unaddressed part of the AKI recovery plan.\n\nThe AKINow Recovery Workgroup facilitated a multidisciplinary discussion of hospital discharge planning, interventions to impact post-AKI care, and challenges and opportunities in the care of patients with AKI.

VIB4920 is a novel engineered fusion protein that antagonizes CD40L. It lacks an Fc domain, avoiding the mechanism thought responsible for inducing thromboembolic complications observed with previous CD40/CD40L pathway antagonists. VIB4920 showed safety and tolerability in a phase 1b clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis (PMID: 31019027).\nStudy Design: The VIBRANT trial (NCT05201469) is a proof of concept study of the efficacy and safety of VIB4920 in LN. Up to 114 participants with active LN will undergo a kidney biopsy with collection of a research core at baseline, followed by therapy with standard doses of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), methylprednisolone, and a rapid glucocorticoid (GC) taper to 5 mg prednisone/d.

In 2022, five additional medical centers joint the registry. The registry collects clinical data throughout the disease course at regular intervals, complemented by biosampling and a genetic work-up. We additionally established a digital histopathology work-flow that enables the multicentric evaluation of renal biopsies by an expert panel.\nResults:\nNinety-eight patients have enrolled in the FOrMe registry, 73 adults and 25 pediatric patients accumulating 625 patient-years.\nThe mean age at diagnosis was 38 years (IQR 19-52 years) for adult and 4 years (IQR 2-7 years) for children. Thirty-five (47.9%) patients were classified as adult FSGS and 35 (47.9%) as MCD. The number of different immunosuppressant medications ranged from 1 to up to 4 medications to achieve or maintain remission. In genetic analyses of 41 patients, we found potential causative mutations in 7/41 (17%) analyzed adult patients and 7/11 (64%) of pediatric patients.\nConclusion\nThe German FOrMe registry is recruiting since April 2019 and a significant number of patients could be included. The crosslinking of highly granular and carefully reviewed clinical data, laboratory values, genetics and pathology enables new insights in the disease course of MCD and FSGS in central Europe. In combination with biosampling, the FOrMe registry enables a translational research and may spark new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The high yield of genetic mutations in this population argues for a low threshold for genetic analysis in MCD- and FSGS-patients.

We hypothesize that treating patients with PMN with both rituximab (RTX, a B-cell depleting agent) and belimumab (BEL, a monoclonal antibody directed against B cell activating factor) will result in greater depletion of memory B cells, limit the re-emergence of autoreactive B cells, and lead to a more sustained response.\nStudy design: REBOOT (NCT03949855) is a phase 2, multicenter, two-part clinical trial (Figure 1).

There is no practice standard for how to care for patients who survive an episode of AKI after hospitalization. Thus, the workgroup conducted two focus groups to understand current practices and gaps in care after an episode of AKI.\n\nTwo focus groups were held, one dedicated to care of patients who required outpatient dialysis for AKI (AKI-D) and one for those who developed AKI but did not require outpatient dialysis (AKI non-D). Diverse stakeholders were included: nephrologists, intensivists, nurses, pharmacists, administrators, patients who survived AKI and their care partners. Focus groups addressed facilitators and barriers to AKI follow-up, approaches to health care delivery (by whom, when, and how), and evidence-based practices that could improve patient outcomes. Detailed notes were taken and core concepts were summarized.\n\nCore findings from the AKI-D focus group were that there were several barriers to optimal post-AKI care: 1) heterogeneity in the definition of kidney recovery, 2) lack of evidence on who will achieve kidney recovery, 3) lack of guidance on how to monitor kidney recovery in dialysis units, and 5) suboptimal transition of care plans. In the AKI non-D group, high variability in care delivered after hospital discharge was the core theme identified. Patients with AKI were followed up by primary care, nephrology or other specialties, and using different modalities (in-person versus telehealth). In terms of potential interventions to improve patient outcomes there was consensus on the need to resume or initiate therapies including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors after AKI recovery, but the timing of this intervention was variable. Participants emphasized the role of physical and cognitive rehabilitation as an unaddressed part of the AKI recovery plan.\n\nThe AKINow Recovery Workgroup facilitated a multidisciplinary discussion of hospital discharge planning, interventions to impact post-AKI care, and challenges and opportunities in the care of patients with AKI.

VIB4920 is a novel engineered fusion protein that antagonizes CD40L. It lacks an Fc domain, avoiding the mechanism thought responsible for inducing thromboembolic complications observed with previous CD40/CD40L pathway antagonists. VIB4920 showed safety and tolerability in a phase 1b clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis (PMID: 31019027).\nStudy Design: The VIBRANT trial (NCT05201469) is a proof of concept study of the efficacy and safety of VIB4920 in LN. Up to 114 participants with active LN will undergo a kidney biopsy with collection of a research core at baseline, followed by therapy with standard doses of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), methylprednisolone, and a rapid glucocorticoid (GC) taper to 5 mg prednisone/d.

In 2022, five additional medical centers joint the registry. The registry collects clinical data throughout the disease course at regular intervals, complemented by biosampling and a genetic work-up. We additionally established a digital histopathology work-flow that enables the multicentric evaluation of renal biopsies by an expert panel.\nResults:\nNinety-eight patients have enrolled in the FOrMe registry, 73 adults and 25 pediatric patients accumulating 625 patient-years.\nThe mean age at diagnosis was 38 years (IQR 19-52 years) for adult and 4 years (IQR 2-7 years) for children. Thirty-five (47.9%) patients were classified as adult FSGS and 35 (47.9%) as MCD. The number of different immunosuppressant medications ranged from 1 to up to 4 medications to achieve or maintain remission.

The crosslinking of highly granular and carefully reviewed clinical data, laboratory values, genetics and pathology enables new insights in the disease course of MCD and FSGS in central Europe. In combination with biosampling, the FOrMe registry enables a translational research and may spark new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

We hypothesize that treating patients with PMN with both rituximab (RTX, a B-cell depleting agent) and belimumab (BEL, a monoclonal antibody directed against B cell activating factor) will result in greater depletion of memory B cells, limit the re-emergence of autoreactive B cells, and lead to a more sustained response.\nStudy design: REBOOT (NCT03949855) is a phase 2, multicenter, two-part clinical trial (Figure 1).

AR assessment informs about susceptibility to hypertensive renal injury and thus may influence management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In rats, AR assessment has typically involved measuring the recovery of renal blood flow (RBF) after acute step blood pressure (BP) changes under anesthesia, via AR indices quantifying fractional changes in RBF relative to BP. We developed a Short Segment AR Index (SSARI) methodology for AR assessment in conscious animals (Bidani et al., JASN 31(2):324-336, 2020).

For each design, several scenarios for IAKD resistance, pressure drop across and flow through the IAKD and device inlet graft together with vital signs were varied to simulate patient-specific needs. Model optimization was performed by modifying several parameters.", "In both configurations, an increase in the internal device resistance twofold resulted in a reduction of flow by 25% through the IAKD. Strong interdependencies between the device resistance, the patient\u2019s MAP and flow through the IAKD were also observed. During model fine-tuning, the length and diameter of the inlet graft was the most influential parameter to modulate flow through the IAKD (up to 40% in the parallel configuration, see Fig 1d).", "The HM can investigate clinically relevant scenarios to tailor an IAKD for renal failure patients. Our analysis suggests that there is a complex interplay between the patient\u2019s systemic circulation and the IAKD, necessitating detailed hemodynamic analysis. Depending on the patient\u2019s needs, it is possible to personalize an IAKD that can best serve to maintain hemodynamic stability and hemodialysis efficiency.", ""], ["Ex-vivo systems modeling human kidney tubules may be used for high-throughput drug screening and mechanistic disease studies. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an important tubular disease to model, as it is responsible for 2% of worldwide renal failure. Proximal and distal tubules are affected differently in PKD settings in terms of fluid-activated transport and inflammation, leading to GFR changes and ultimately renal failure. It is thus important to establish a system in which segment-specific human-derived PKD tubules may be studied in physiologically relevant conditions, such as fluid flow.", "Using photolithography, we created a microfluidic chip with a channel insert and ports for media delivery. We then derived kidney organoids from both normal and PKD patient-sourced induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We extracted proximal and distal tubule cells from these organoids, and delivered them to our chip system. Unidirectional fluid flow for various time frames was introduced through the system and changes in the tubule structure and function were examined. Tubule volume changes, marker protein expression and localization, and transport properties were assessed and compared between normal and PKD disease tubular chips.", "Kidney organoids formed tubular structures which mimicked human kidney structures and replicated PKD-like cyst formation. Kidney organoid-harvested cells exhibited nephron segment-specific marker protein localization and function, and formed tubular structures when introduced to the chip-system. Normal tubule chip systems exhibited human kidney-relevant structure and function, while PKD systems showed aberration in tubule volume. Diseased systems exhibited altered localization of marker proteins such as E-cadherin, as well as diminished transport capacity of solutes (e.g., 6-Carboxy fluorescein). More importantly, diseased tubules showed aberrations in structure and function in a segment-specific manner, mimicking in vivo disease pathology.", "We have developed and validated a model system to study the effects of PKD ex vivo. Our platform will allow both mechanistic studies and drug testing in a nephron-segment specific way. Its conductivity to both distal and proximal human iPSC-derived tubules allows researchers to study disease in a personalized manner."], ["The development of glomeruli is complex. Its dynamics and spatio-temporal coordination during the formation of the glomerular architecture are still poorly understood. Classical histopathological methods and microscopy techniques yield a rather limited scope of visualization and reconstruction of evolving glomeruli that can only be fully comprehended in a 3-dimensional context.", "To study the successive buildup and maturation of podocytes during glomerulogenesis, we used neonatal kidneys (P0-P7) from transgenic PodocyteTRAP mice in combination with an adjusted ethyl cinnamate (ECi)-based clearing approach for immunostaining and subsequent 2-photon and light-sheet microscopy. We used IMARIS for detailed morphometric analysis and 3D-reconstruction of podocytes and glomeruli during advanced stages of kidney development.", "Tissue clearing is a technique to render biological samples transparent, thereby allowing for high-dimensional 3D-imaging of structures deep within the tissue without the need for tissue-sectioning. We used this technique for 3D-visualization, reconstruction and analysis of different glomerular developmental stages (renal vesicles, S-phase, capillary loop, maturing glomerulus) in transparent kidneys of P0 to P7 and adult PodocyteTRAP mice. ECi-clearing followed by 2-photon and light-sheet microscopy allowed for 10-fold larger imaging depth compared to uncleared kidneys (~1500\u00b5m vs. ~150\u00b5m). EGFP-L10a+ podocytes in ECi-treated PodocyteTRAP kidneys were easily identified by their robust epifluorescence, with eGFP-L10a intensifying as podocyte maturation progressed. We conducted detailed analyses which included comprehensive quantifications of glomerular volume changes during postnatal kidney development.", "The combination of ECi-tissue clearing with 2-photon and light-sheet microscopy in the PodocyteTRAP model is well suited for high-dimensional imaging of renal tissue including detailed morphometry of maturing glomeruli in whole neonatal mouse kidneys. Moreover, this approach could also be useful for holistic histopathological analyses and assessments in various glomerular disease models including experimental GN and FSGS."], ["Combining kidney organoids with microfluidic chips has promise as a powerful tool to improve organoid maturation, vascularization, and create a highly tunable environment for drug testing or disease modeling. Organoids can be transferred into microfluidic channels after differentiation, but this risks irreversibly damaging the newly formed structures or inducing their dedifferentiation upon attachment in the channel. Thus, we have developed a protocol to carry out kidney organoid differentiation entirely within a microfluidic device.", "A positive-relief mold was generated using a stereolithography 3D printer to make a PDMS device with multiple channels separated by micro-pillars, which could accommodate a physiological flow rate. Then, we optimized our standard kidney organoid protocol for the microfluidic chip by altering the ECM surface coating, undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cell seeding density, and timing of media exchanges to support the much smaller growth environment. Following these modifications, we identified several organoids in each device with brightfield microscopy by day 18 of differentiation and fixed them for immunostaining.", "The presence of kidney-specific cells and structures was confirmed by confocal microscopy after fixing and staining for podocyte, proximal tubule, and endothelial cells. The organization of these organoids was comparable to those made in 24-well plates indicating that we have successfully optimized our standard differentiation protocol for a microfluidic platform. Increased endothelial cells were observed in chip-differentiated organoids, compared to 24-well plates. The endothelial cells integrated into organoids in 3D, and demonstrated a tendency to interact with the basal membrane of podocytes which was not observed in 24-wells.", "This protocol eliminates transfer steps during the differentiation process by creating a stable environment for organoid development within our microfluidic chips. In addition, the confined growth environment of the microfluidic chips or the intermittent shear stress from media changes may be inducing endothelial cell differentiation and podocyte-endothelial cell interactions.The endothelial interactions observed in organoids grown in these devices provides a strong foundation for future vascularization work."], ["Although focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is initially caused by direct injury to podocytes, their neighboring parietal epithelial cells (PECs) also undergo secondary molecular changes that further damage the glomerulus. The crosstalk between injured podocytes and PECs is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of appropriate experimental models for study. The goal of this study is to establish an in vitro coculture model to determine what mediators derived from injured podocytes cause PECs damage.", "We engineered a novel open microfluidic coculture device where two culture chambers are separated by a half wall that can be connected to study intercellular interactions. Diffusion calculations suggested that moderate sized (10 kDa) signaling molecules take ~ 2 d to reach the other chamber via diffusion. In mouse podocyte-PEC coculture studies, immortalized mouse podocytes were exposed to cytotoxic sheep anti-podocyte antibodies, puramycin, or Adriamycin, and cocultured with mouse PECs for up to 96 h. In human podocyte studies, primary human podocytes were also injured with anti-podocyte antibodies, puramycin, or Adriamycin. Podocyte responses were assessed by phase-contrast imaging, MTT assays, and immunostaining. Immunostaining also measured PEC activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).", "Immediatly following podocyte injury, both mouse and human podocytes displayed foot process effacement and cell body shrinkage. In addition, cell viability was decreased of injured podocytes. The normal contiguous monolayer of mouse podocytes was disrupted, accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in the de novo expression of the injury marker desmin, and a decrease in the cytockeletal marker F-actin along the cell borders. In podocyte-PEC coculture, PECs were activated (expressed CD44) accompanied by increased SM22, an EMT marker. A time course of bulk RNA seq results are pending.", "This novel in vitro microfluidic model for coculturing injured podocytes and neighboring cells has the potential to study many pathways involved in podocyte-related intercellular crosstalk, glomerular disease mechanisms, and drug screening."], ["Fungal infections are an exceedingly rare form of granulomatous interstitial nephritis (GIN). Most cases of GIN are associated with sarcoidosis or drug exposure. The most common etiology of infectious GIN is mycobacteria. Herein, we report a case of fungal GIN diagnosed in a patient with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) receiving low-dose corticosteroids.", "A 54-year-old woman was hospitalized with acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia and thrombocytopenia following 2 weeks of generalized weakness and altered mental status. The patient had a medical history of SLE and remote history of class III and V SLE glomerulonephritis (GN) for which she had received immunosuppression 27 years prior to presentation. Current medications included low-dose prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, nifedipine, furosemide and insulin glargine. Upon arrival, she was noted to be hypotensive and oliguric. Laboratory data showed a serum creatinine of 3.4 mg/dL (baseline 1.0 mg/dL). Urinalysis revealed hematuria, proteinuria and leukocyturia. Urine microscopy revealed budding yeast and pseudohyphae. Urine culture was negative and blood culture was positive for Proteus mirabilis. CT of the abdomen revealed bilateral perinephric stranding consistent with pyelonephritis. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, pulse steroids for possible SLE flare, and dialysis for volume and metabolic derangements. Kidney biopsy was performed for suspected relapse of SLE-GN. Specimen revealed acute tubular necrosis, class II SLE-GN (activity index 0) and focal fungal granuloma with budding yeast and hyphae (by electron microscopy). Repeat cultures grew Candida albicans and Candida glabrata in blood and Candida albicans in the urine. The patient was started on liposomal amphotericin B and her kidney function recovered to a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL.", "Candiduria is a common finding on routine evaluation of hospitalized patients with AKI and often represents colonization or a urinary tract infection. However, in the context of immunosuppression, those findings should raise suspicion for fungal GIN, as shown in this case, so that appropriate intervention can be promptly implemented."], ["Propofol is a short acting intravenous anesthetic and sedative agent. Propofol related infusion syndrome (PRIS) is rare but associated with very high mortality rate. Commonly seen in patients receiving dose >4 mg/kg/hr for prolonged period > 48 hours. The pathogenesis involves impaired beta oxidation of fatty acids,disruption in electron transport chain,blockage of beta adrenergic receptors and calcium channels on myocardial cell. Clinically presents as cardiac dysfunction (bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia and asystole), high anion gap metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipemia, AKI and hepatocellular injury.", "69 year old male with ICU course complicated by sepsis from serratia bacteremia post gastric sleeve leak repair, ARDS, oliguric AKI, cardiac arrhythmia, hypotension had recurrent clogging of dialysis filter with a creamy greasy substance. The patient was being sedated with high dose of propofol >25mcg/kg/hr for 1 week. Elevated triglyceride level 799mg, worsening kidney function and acidemia, worsening hepatocellular transaminitis (ALT 283, AST 135) with mild elevation in CPK 293 was noted. Propfol infusion syndrome was suspected and the drug was held following which his transaminitis, acidosis, hyperlipidemia and rhabdomyolysis improved. His renal function continued to decline and required HD.", "A creamy clogged dialysis filter raised suspicion of hyperlipidemia and PRIS in our patient. Severe illness and use of exogeneous cathecolamines predisposed our patient to this condition. Bariatric surgery patients with possible carbohydrate depletion are at higher risk. Early identification and low threshold for suspicion of PRIS can help in reducing mortality from this condition.", ""], ["Two common methods to measure creatinine concentration in the blood are the Jaffe and enzymatic method. Enzymatic creatinine assays have been reported to be affected by the presence of catecholamines. Specifically, dopamine and dobutamine infusions are known to cause falsely decreased creatinine levels due to interference with the peroxidase reaction.", "We present a 68 year old male with a past medical history of CKD stage 3b (baseline creatinine 1.7 mg/dL), interstitial lung disease status-post double lung transplant, coronary artery disease, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction, and restrictive pericarditis who was admitted for decompensated heart failure. The patient also had acute kidney injury (AKI), presumed from diuretic refractory cardiorenal syndrome, with consistently rising creatinine levels since hospital admission. On hospital day 16, the patient\u2019s creatinine decreased from 4.55 mg/dL to 1.28 mg/dL in 24 hours without any renal replacement therapy or medical changes other than dopamine infusion was started the day prior. Serum creatinine over the next few days sporadically fluctuated from 1.81 mg/dL to 5.28 mg/dL. After discussion with nursing staff, we confirmed that labs were drawn using the same intravenous line being used for dopamine infusion. When the nurse obtained labs via a peripheral venous puncture on hospital day 18, the creatinine level was 5.15 mg/dL, most consistent with the patient\u2019s AKI. The patient was started on dialysis soon after due to poor clearance and volume control.", "It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the artifactual effects that dobutamine and dopamine infusions have on serum creatinine levels. A recent survey shows a lack of this awareness among healthcare providers. This issue can be avoided by educating nursing staff to avoid drawing creatinine levels using the same infusion lines for dopamine or dobutamine. It is also noted that the Jaffe method is unaffected by the presence of catecholamines, though the majority of labs now employ the enzymatic method. Consideration could also be made to use cystatin C if readily available."], ["Antihistamines such as doxylamine, represent common components of over-the-counter sleep-inducing agents. The easy availability of these substances increases the potential for both intentional overdose by adults and inadvertent ingestion by children. Doxylamine overdose has increased in recent years due to its availability as an over-the-counter drug commonly used as a nighttime sleep aid. Clinical studies describe symptoms of severe doxylamine intoxication such as rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, impaired consciousness, seizures, and cardiopulmonary arrest", "A 52 year old male with a history of HTN and opioid dependence presented with acute onset right-sided weakness, numbness, right buttock pain, nausea, and vomiting. He reported taking 30 tablets of doxylamine the night prior to presentation due to difficulty sleeping. Upon admission, patient's labs showed elevated creatinine kinase >100,000, blood urea nitrogen/Creatinine 71/5.8, aspartate aminotransferase 2170, alanine aminotransferase 536, and phosphate 7.9. Patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for severe rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure, and acute liver failure secondary to doxylamine overdose. He received n-acetylcysteine for acute liver failure and was started on aggressive IV hydration. He remained oliguric and a hemodialysis catheter was placed on hospital day (HD) 1 for emergent dialysis. Throughout the hospital stay, patient received three cycles of dialysis. Urine output gradually improved and the patient was transferred to the medical floors on HD 5. He was subsequently discharged home on HD 13 with an outpatient nephrology appointment.", "Acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis due to doxylamine toxicity can result in poor prognosis, necessitating emergent dialysis and critical care management as seen in our patient. The accessibility of this drug alongside its potential for abuse warrants discussion among healthcare providers. Additionally, the adverse outcomes associated with doxylamine overdose demands that clinicians act immediately in treating patients with suspected intoxication. Rapid intervention may prevent progression of renal failure, ultimately reducing the risk of developing chronic kidney disease and requiring long-term dialysis."], ["Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a commonly used antibiotic in the clinical setting.

Imaging at the time showed no nephrolithiasis. He presented to the emergency department on the 9th day with decreased urine output, acute kidney injury (Cr 4.5 mg/dL), and hyperkalemia (K 6.8 meq/L). A repeat renal U/S showed the interval development of multiple bilateral renal calculi with moderate hydronephrosis. Urinalysis demonstrated birefringent crystals under polarized light, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of TMP-SMX nephrolithiasis. The patient was treated with IV and oral bicarbonate and discharged on oral bicarbonate for one month. Two weeks later, serum Cr had decreased to 1.3 mg/dL. A renal U/S done 6 weeks after alkalinization was initiated showed complete resolution of the hydronephrosis and renal calculi. Cr was 1.1 mg/dL.", "Nephrolithiasis caused by sulfamethoxazole crystals use is rare, and effective medical management strategies have not been well described. Urinary alkalinization is based on the premise of increased solubility of sulfonamides at an alkaline pH. We present a case in which rapid improvement in clinical trajectory occurred soon after urinary alkalinization.
