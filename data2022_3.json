Imaging at the time showed no nephrolithiasis. He presented to the emergency department on the 9th day with decreased urine output, acute kidney injury (Cr 4.5 mg/dL), and hyperkalemia (K 6.8 meq/L). A repeat renal U/S showed the interval development of multiple bilateral renal calculi with moderate hydronephrosis. Urinalysis demonstrated birefringent crystals under polarized light, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of TMP-SMX nephrolithiasis. The patient was treated with IV and oral bicarbonate and discharged on oral bicarbonate for one month. Two weeks later, serum Cr had decreased to 1.3 mg/dL. A renal U/S done 6 weeks after alkalinization was initiated showed complete resolution of the hydronephrosis and renal calculi. Cr was 1.1 mg/dL.", "Nephrolithiasis caused by sulfamethoxazole crystals use is rare, and effective medical management strategies have not been well described. Urinary alkalinization is based on the premise of increased solubility of sulfonamides at an alkaline pH. We present a case in which rapid improvement in clinical trajectory occurred soon after urinary alkalinization. This report is unique in that we demonstrate both the growth and resolution of the stones in a rapid time frame. Further study will be required to determine if this regimen is an effective alternative to ureteral stenting or nephrostomy tubes."], ["Enfortumab-vedotin is an antibody-drug molecule recently approved by the FDA for urothelial and other cancers. Data submitted to the FDA lists \u201cincreased creatinine in 20% of patients and ARF in a small minority of patients\u201d as an adverse event noted in phase 3 clinical trials of this drug but little information is available beyond that. Here, we present a case of severe acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) thought to be secondary to enfortumab-vedotin use.", "An 86-year-old male with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, CKD3b (baseline Cr 2.1), chronic right hydronephrosis and recurrent transitional cell cancer of bladder s/p TURBT was initially treated with 5 cycles of pembrolizumab but was switched to enfortumab due to an ineffective response. Patient\u2019s last dose of pembrolizumab was administered 4 weeks prior to cycle 1 of enfortumab. He received a total of 4 monthly cycles (3 weekly doses each cycle) of enfortumab with CBC and BMP obtained with each infusion. During cycle 3 infusion 2, peripheral eosinophilia (15.8%) was noted, which worsened after the next infusion 8 days later to 23.2%. Eosinophilia normalized (2.7%) prior to initiation of cycle 4. A similar rise in eosinophilia to 9.1% was seen after cycle 4 infusion 1. Labs demonstrated AKI (Cr 6.2 mg/dl) prior to the 2nd infusion so further enfortumab infusions were held, but eosinophils rose to 27.1% and a renal biopsy was performed which showed extensive AIN on H&E staining. Patient was treated with steroids and enfortumab discontinuation with rapid recovery of renal function.", "To our knowledge, this is the first report of AIN caused by enfortumab-vedotin. While delayed AKI caused by AIN has been reported in the setting of pembrolizumab use, the rise and fall of eosinophilia seen during the 3rd and 4th infusion cycles argues strongly that this is the likely culprit, with pembrolizumab perhaps playing a role in immune system priming. Vedotin, a microtubule inhibitor, was first linked to brentuximab and used in hematologic malignancies, but it has been subsequently linked to a wide variety of other cancer targeting antibodies. There have been multiple reports of Karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN) linked to brentuximab-vedotin. Our data coupled with these previous reports suggest that the eosinophil count should be monitored, and AIN should be considered in patients the steadily rising number of antibody drug complexes containing vedotin."], ["Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder. Only 8% of patients present with disease at extra-pulmonary sites without lung involvement. Granulomatous interstitial nephritis (GIN) is the classic kidney lesion found in sarcoidosis. However, clinically significant renal sarcoidosis is exceedingly rare. We present a case with acute renal failure (ARF) requiring temporary dialysis due to GIN without lung involvement on presentation.", "A 39-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency room with nausea and vomiting. Labs showed a serum creatinine (Cr) 13.29 mg/dL (1.1mg/dL 3 months prior), blood urea nitrogen 106 mg/dL, bicarbonate 13 mg/dL. Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.23 with PaCO2 of 33 mmHg. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein and 2 red blood cells. Dialysis was started for acidosis and uremia. Renal ultrasound showed no obstruction or chronic changes. IV methylprednisolone was started and she underwent kidney biopsy for ARF. Pathology showed GIN. The angiotensin-converting enzyme was 156 nmol/mL/min, and calcium was normal. CT scan of the chest showed no adenopathy or pulmonary disease. She was weaned off dialysis with adequate urine output and a Cr of 2mg/dL. She was discharged on 60 mg prednisone daily for 2 weeks followed by a 3-month taper. After stopping steroids, she developed nausea and vomiting again and presented to the ER with a Cr >10mg/dL. Repeat CT scan of the chest now showed bilateral hilar adenopathy. Bronchoscopy was performed and lymph node biopsy showed non-caseating granulomas confirming sarcoidosis. She subsequently improved clinically with standard steroid treatment.", "The most common renal feature of sarcoidosis is nephrocalcinosis caused by dysregulated calcium homeostasis, followed by GIN. About 4-10% of renal sarcoidosis may progress to end-stage renal disease. Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment. In this case, the patient was first found to have GIN with normocalcemia and was treated timely with steroids. Lung involvement was absent until steroids were tapered off 3 months later highlighting the importance of closely monitoring lung features if renal sarcoidosis is detected. Given the lack of treatment guidelines, a longer course of steroids for clinically significant renal sarcoidosis may be needed to prevent full-blown lung sarcoidosis."], ["Medication-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a diagnostic challenge because specific testing is lacking. In addition, renal-limited TMA may lack classic hematological manifestations. We report a case of possible eltrombopag-associated TMA.", "A 46-year-old woman, with history of lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) on anticoagulation, was admitted with acute kidney injury (AKI). She had recently been hospitalized with a subdural hematoma and thrombocytopenia that was attributed to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This had been managed with cessation of anticoagulation, rituximab, IVIG and eltrombopag (a thrombopoietin receptor agonist). Her dose of eltrombopag had been increased just prior to discharge. Her labs were notable for: creatinine 2.91 mg/dl (baseline 0.6), thrombocytopenia, anemia. Markers of hemolysis including schistocytes were negative. A kidney biopsy revealed extensive microvascular thrombosis consistent with a TMA and widespread cortical necrosis. She was treated with corticosteroids and eculizumab and was initiated on hemodialysis.", "Eltrombopag has been associated with complications including venous thrombosis, stroke, and, rarely, TMA. The mechanism for this risk is unclear and appears to be independent of platelet levels in some cases. In this case, the patient had multiple risk factors for thrombosis including her underlying APLS and the cessation of anticoagulation. However, the AKI developed shortly after the dose of eltrombopag was increased suggesting a temporal relationship. Awareness to the possibility of eltrombopag-associated TMA is important for patient safety in patients with worsening kidney function, especially in the setting of recent dose adjustments. Patients with APLS and ITP may be at higher risk.", ""], ["Scleroderma renal crisis is a rare but recognized complication of systemic sclerosis most notably characterized by the presence of abrupt hypertension and progressive renal failure. Here we present a rare case of normotensive scleroderma renal crisis.", "A 51 year old female with history of systemic sclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus presented with worsening lower extremity edema and shortness of breath. She was treated initially with diuretics and antibiotics for volume overload and pneumonia. 13 days later, respiratory status declined and patient became anuric with subsequent rapid creatinine rise from baseline of 1.5mg/dL to 4.98 mg/dL. Urinalysis was significant for 3+ protein and 3+ blood with urine protein-creatinine ratio of 3.2. Serologic workup was negative for the following: ANCA, MPO, PR3, dsDNA, SSA, SSB , C3, C4, and Anti GBM. There was noted positivity for Scl-70 antibody and ANA at 1:1280 in a homogenous pattern. Renal sonogram revealed normal kidney size, patent bilateral renal arteries, normal cortical thickness, and no hydronephrosis. Echocardiogram was obtained which revealed new reduction in ejection fraction to 30%. Blood pressure from admission and until this point remained within systolic range of 120-150mmHg. The patient was transferred to ICU and renal biopsy was obtained which revealed diffuse acute tubular injury and arteriolar vessels with onion skinning and severe luminal narrowing. She was initiated on continuous renal replacement therapy and captopril. Her course was complicated by worsening respiratory failure and septic/cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and inotropes. She was unable to consistently tolerate captopril dosing due to subsequent hypotension and eventually passed.", "This case illustrates the diagnostic dilemma seen in patients with normotensive scleroderma renal crisis. Although only a small minority of patients with scleroderma renal crisis present without associated hypertension, these patients are at greater risk for delayed diagnosis and exposure to therapies that may worsen underlying disease process (i.e. steroids). Clinicians should retain high clinical suspicion for scleroderma renal crises with normotension and be aware of comorbidities that may be masking underlying hypertension. Furthermore, kidney biopsy should be considered in these patients for definitive diagnosis and management."], ["Studies on AKI in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant(HSCT) consider heterogeneous definitions for AKI include a miscellaneous of hematologic diagnoses in their cohorts.

Herein, we present a case of an adult who presented with MIS.", "A 38 year-old Caucasian male, who had contracted COVID-19 two months prior to presentation, was admitted with 1-week history of abdominal pain, frontal headache, fever of 104\u00b0 F and dark urine. His exam was notable for erythematous, blanching macular rash on his trunk and arms. He quickly progressed to shock, requiring vasopressor and ventilator support.\n\nHe developed acute kidney injury, with serum creatinine (SCr) increasing to 7.09 mg/dL from 1.9 mg/dL at presentation and required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Urinalysis revealed > 182 mostly non-dysmorphic RBCs and random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 1,273 mg/g. The previous urological evaluation was negative, prompting suspicion for IgA nephropathy. Serum IgG and IgE were elevated, with normal levels of IgA and IgM. Due to development of pulmonary infiltrate with hypoxia, there was concern for pulmonary-renal syndrome. The serologies were negative, including ANCA, anti-GBM, ANA, hepatitis B and C, HIV and complements. Blood cultures were also negative. Elevations were noted in interleukin (IL) 6 at 114.3 pg/mL, soluble IL-2 receptor at 42364.7 pg/mL, and IL-1\u03b2 at 10.2 pg/mL. The patient had antibodies against COVID-19 IgG spike protein at 1.91 IV.\n\nSkin biopsy revealed vacuolar interface dermatitis with eosinophils, consistent with MIS in adults (MIS-A) in the setting of recent COVID infection. The decision was made to treat with solumedrol and IVIG. Within 2 days of IVIG therapy, his renal function improved significantly. CRRT was discontinued and he was transferred out of ICU.\n\nThree months following the hospitalization, his SCr improved to 0.9 mg/dL without hematuria.", "Acute renal injury is common in pediatric cases of MIS, with an excellent rate of renal recovery.

He develops respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock, rectal bleeding causing interruptions in anticoagulation (AC), oliguric AKI, and hyperkalemia for which CKRT is initiated with a PrisMax device and a 15-cm-long 13-French Power-Trialysis catheter placed in the right IJ. Despite good access function and a mean filtration fraction of 15.3%, recurrent EC thrombosis develops, for which various AC strategies are trialed [Table]. Only the combination of systemic bivalirudin and RCA proves effective. However, he ultimately dies after the family opts to transition to comfort measures.", "The use of direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) as AC for CKRT had only been reported pre- pandemic in small studies or case series, with only one case report describing argatroban combined with RCA. Though RCA has repeatedly been shown in non-COVID-19 patients to be superior to UFH as AC for CKRT, both therapies in COVID-19 often fail to prevent EC thrombosis, leading many to try other strategies such as DTIs or RCA combined with UFH. In our patient, UFH with RCA allowed one EC to last >24h, but multiple subsequent ECs clotted in <12h. However, by combining bivalirudin and RCA we prevented premature thrombosis of the subsequent two ECs. This is the first report of using bivalirudin with RCA for CKRT AC and suggests the combination may be useful in COVID-19 patients with recurrent CKRT circuit clotting.", ""], ["Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive condition defined by cytokine storm and blood cell phagocytosis.

We report a case in which a patient with HLH developed acute kidney injury requiring dialysis leading to death.", "A 63-year-old with stable HIV and Type 2 Diabetes was referred to the Emergency Department (ER) due to septic shock and an unsolved oral ulcer. For 3 months he had been seen at the Dermatology Clinic because of a slow-growing hard palate lesion, impairing food intake and leading to malnutrition and weight loss. After clinical stabilization at the ER, he was transferred to the ICU, developed significant pancytopenia (Hb 6.7 g/dL, 450 total leucocytes/\u03bcL, 41.000 platelets/\u03bcL), hyperferritinemia (41.377 mg/dL), hypertriglyceridemia (318 mg/dL) and was diagnosed with Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis according to HScore and bone marrow aspirate showing hemophagocytosis. Chest Computed Tomography revealed prominent mediastinal lymphadenomegaly, raising suspicion of lymphoma, and PCR for Epstein-Barr Virus was positive both on bone marrow (927.635 uI/mL) and blood (8.903 uI/mL) analyses. Days after guided antibiotic treatment for Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection, hemodynamic stability, absence of fever, nephrotoxic drug withdrawal and ongoing pancytopenia, serum creatinine levels rose from 1.74 mg/dL to 3.78 mg/dL, BUN levels rose from 67 mg/dL to 105 mg/dL and urinary output decreased from 800 mL/day to 200 mL/day. The patient was placed on Slow Low Efficiency Dialysis due to failure of conservative AKI management.

The diagnosis of AAV in a patient presenting with otological manifestations can be challenging when otological symptoms are the predominant presenting feature or when ANCA testing results negative. A delayed diagnosis in these settings may result in more advanced hearing loss or recurrent AAV flares.", "A 66-year-old woman with CKDIIIa and hypertension presented with polyarthralgias, AKI, severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, oral mucositis, scleritis, and hand joint pain with rash. Laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, negative anti-MPO and anti-PR3 titers, positive ANA(1:320), normal complement levels, and otherwise negative serologic workup. MRI brain showed left middle ear cavity scarring. She was given steroids for diagnosis of vestibular neuritis, labyrinthitis, and reactive arthritis with persistent hearing loss but recovery of AKI and other symptoms. Several months later she developed altered mental status, fevers, and AKI, and was found to have a UTI. After initial improvement with antibiotics, steroids, and IV fluids, she developed recurrent polyarthralgias and AKI. Kidney biopsy demonstrated pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis.

With non-recovery of her hearing loss, she ultimately underwent cochlear implant surgery.", "Otological symptoms such as sensorineural hearing loss incurred in this case along with AKI should prompt an evaluation for AAV, as otitis media is a relatively common manifestation of disease. This case demonstrates the specific diagnostic challenge presented by an ANCA-negative pauci-immune vasculitis with otological involvement. In comparison to cases with positive ANCA serologies, cases of MPO- and PR3-negative pauci-immune vasculitis present a significant diagnostic challenge, being less common and less readily recognized.

Native-kidney BKVN after extra-renal SOT is uncommon. Intensity of immunosuppression is a well-known risk factor for viral replication; ureteral stenting has also been associated with BKVN. However, since clinical manifestations of BKV infection often include genitourinary (GU) tract pathology, ureteral strictures may be either a symptom or risk factor of infection. Although rare, it is important for clinicians consider BKVN even in patients with non-renal SOT, especially in the clinical context of known GU disease.\n\nTreatment of native BKVN is based on experience from treatment of BKVN in kidney transplant patients.

She was discharged on POD 4, but presented to the emergency room the next day with new onsent fatigue. Labs were notable for a sCr of 2.3 mg/dL, peaking at 3.7 on POD 7. Clinical adjudication determined the likely etiology of AKI to be associated with NSAID. She underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy on POD 11, with findings consistent with mild acute tubular injury and no significant interstitial fibrosis nor tubular atrophy. Tissue proteomic analysis demonstrated tissue inflammation and extracellular matrix changes in the glomeruli and tubule-interstitium (Table 1). These cellular changes were present without histologic correlates.", "As NSAIDs were considered to be the primary driver of the participant\u2019s AKI, at the molecular level we suspected that prostaglandin expression may have been altered. However, proteomic interrogation revealed a more dynamic molecular landscape, with changes noted in prostaglandin synthesis in response to NSAIDs as well as signs of intra-renal inflammation and fibrosis not evident by histopathology alone. These findings illustrate that routine histology techniques do not necessarily capture the full complexity of cellular injury.", ""], ["The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins family exert an essential role in DNA replication and DNA damage repair. Recently, it has reported that MCMs are implicated in various tumors and their expression correlates with the prognosis and recurrence of tumors. However, the role of MCMs in kidney diseases remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of MCM4 in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced AKI.", "Male C57 mice were intraperitoneally injected with cisplatin for 3 days. In vitro, NRK-52E cells were treated with cisplatin for 12h. Expressions of MCM4, NGAL, cleaved-caspase-3, Bax, p53, p21, 53BP1, USP28 and MAD2B were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. MCM4, 53BP1 and USP28 knockdown were achieved by transfected with siRNA, respectively. Lentivirus transfection was utilized to knock down the expression of MAD2B. Flow cytometry was conducted for cell cycle. CCK-8 assay was conducted to evaluate the cell viability. TUNEL assay was used to detecte the apoptotic cells and ROS detection kit was utilized for ROS detection.", "Here, we show that MCM4 is highly expressed in tubules while less in glomeruli, and the expression of MCM4 is upregulated in mice and NRK-52E cells under cisplatin treatment. Silencing of MCM4 inhibits cell proliferation and delays the entry of S phase, and then aggravates cell apoptosis in cisplatin-treated NRK-52E cells. Mechanistically, MCM4 deficiency results in augmented activity of the 53BP1/p53/p21 pathway, which is a key pathway for regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, based on the previous studies of MAD2B in kidney diseases, we find that MAD2B deficiency inhibits the activity of CDK/Cyclin complex, the phosphorylation of Rb and the transcription level of E2F1, leading to the downregulation of MCM4.", "Therefore, our data revealed the protective role of MCM4 in cisplatin-induced acute kidneyr injury. MCM4 was involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis by 53BP1/USP28/p53/p21 signaling pathway under the cisplatin stimulation. On the other hand, MAD2B could influence the the phosphorylation of Rb and the transcription level of E2F1, resulting in the changes in MCM4 proteins levels. In conclusion, MCM4 maybe a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AKI."], ["Within the last decade, it has been established that necrotic rather than apoptotic cell death critically mediates acute tubular necrosis in AKI. While the involvement of necroptosis and ferroptosis has been established, the role of pyroptosis, the third major form of necrosis, remains unclear in AKI. This form of regulated necrosis requires proteolytic activation of members of the gasdermin family and is considered highly immunogenic. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of pyroptosis and its mechanism of action in AKI.", "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was utilized to detect gasdermin D (GSDMD) in kidney samples of mice after ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Furthermore, gasdermin-deficient mice were investigated in IRI and cisplatin-induced AKI and cisplatin-induced AKI. Mechanistic approaches involved the isolation of renal tubules for studies on cell death propagation and standard biochemistry to detect protein expression kinetics. Finally, MLKL/GSDMDdko mice were generated to investigate the interplay of these caspase-dependent forms of regulated necrosis in AKI.", "In GSDMD-IHC of kidney samples after IRI, we detected as specific signal surrounding necrotic tubules. No such signal was detectable within the tubular compartment at any time. Unexpectedly, GSDMDko mice exhibited higher levels of serum creatine and serum urea as well as more severe tubular damage compared to wild type controls. Unlike whole kidney lysates, freshly isolated renal tubules do not express the GSDMD protein. In isolated renal tubules, no changes in kinetics of cell death propagation were detectable upon genetic GSDMD deficiency. In addition, we generated combined necroptosis/pyroptosis-deficient MLKL/GSDMDdko mice. Here, we demonstrate that co-deletion of MLKL rescued the sensitization of GSDMDko mice. Comparable effects were seen in cisplatin-induced AKI.", "Our study reveals an unexpected protective role of GSDMD in AKI. Our mechanistic studies indicate the effect of GSDMD to function outside the tubular compartment, specifically surrounding areas of tubular necrosis. This infiltrate appears to limit tubular necroptosis in a non-cell autonomous manner. Alongside with these mechanistic insights, our data urge caution when inhibition of pyroptosis is therapeutically considered."], ["Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of hospitalization for which no effective treatments exist. Patients with recovered AKI are at increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). In ischemia-reperfusion (IR) AKI, endothelial injury contributes to capillary rarefaction and development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We previously showed that microRNA (miR)-486-5p protects against IR AKI in mice associated with targeting of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), activation of Akt, and downregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and tumor necrosis factor signaling in proximal tubular cells.

In rats with AKI, miR-486-5p did not affect plasma Cr after 4 weeks, compared to sham rats or rats with AKI alone. However, in rats with AKI, miR-486-5p protected against the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy at 4 weeks. In HUVECs, miR-486-5p decreased the expression of PTEN (p<0.05, N=4), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (p<0.001, N=4).

The Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway regulates the transcription of various genes that encode cytoprotective and detoxifying enzymes and has pivotal roles in the defense against cellular oxidative stress.", "To examine the impact of Nrf2 activation on mitochondrial function in the setting of oxidative stress, we exposed human primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) to cisplatin and used an inhibitor that interrupt the Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction (PPI).", "Cisplatin treatment significantly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increased casp3/7 activity, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, impaired respiration, downregulated genes related to mitochondrial function and decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels. These effects were notably suppressed by co-treatment with the small-molecule Keap1\u2212Nrf2 PPI inhibitor. To assess whether the mitochondrial protective effects of Keap1-inhibition in RPTECs are mediated by GSH, an important scavengers of ROS, we treated cells with L-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH synthesis. Notably, BSO treatment negated the protective effects of the Keap1\u2212Nrf2 PPI inhibitor against cisplatin-induced mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis, while not affecting its ability to induce the transcriptional activation of NRF2 target genes.", "Together, our results show that inhibition of the Keap1\u2013Nrf2 PPI activates the antioxidant machinery for ROS scavenging in RPTECs, and that increased levels of intracellular GSH plays an important protective role against cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular death."], ["A novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of AKI is activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), a neuroimmune circuit. The CAP is initiated by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and subsequent activation of splenic macrophages (M\u03a6) to suppress inflammation. Our previous findings suggest the possibility that Notch signaling pathway (Notch), contributes to the renoprotective effects of CAP. However, a direct relationship between the CAP and Notch has not been reported. In the current study, we focused on Notch in M\u03a6 to unravel the molecular mechanism of CAP and to determine the utility of Notch in ameliorating AKI.", "To test if VNS activates Notch in M\u03a6, we performed electrical VNS before ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). After IRI, the expression of cytokines and Notch2 receptor in M\u03a6 were assessed by qPCR and flow cytometry. M\u03a6-specific Notch2 knockout mice were also subjected to VNS to evaluate whether Notch2 mediates anti-inflammatory responses in M\u03a6. The vagus nerve is heterogeneous and composed of efferent and afferent fibers, and neural circuits related to each fiber bundle are independent though both efferent/afferent VNS attenuate AKI. Thus, to determine if specific neural circuits regulate Notch, we used optogenetics, a tool for controlling the functions of particular neurons by expressing light-responsive proteins such as channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2).", "The mRNA and protein expression of Notch2 was upregulated in splenic M\u03a6 of VNS-treated mice. This was accompanied by a decrease in Tnf-\u03b1 and an increase in Il-10. In splenic M\u03a6 of Notch2 knockout mice subjected to VNS, Tnf-\u03b1 was higher and Il-10 was Iower than VNS-treated littermates, indicating that anti-inflammatory effects of the CAP were attenuated by Notch2 deficiency in M\u03a6. In addition, we performed optogenetic VNS by using transgenic mice expressing ChR2 on vagal efferent fibers. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that efferent VNS did not alter Notch2 protein levels in splenic M\u03a6.", "Our findings suggested that: 1) Notch signaling in splenic M\u03a6 contributes to renoprotection by the CAP, 2) optogenetic stimulation of the vagus nerve showed that efferent VNS does not mediate Notch2 upregulation, suggesting that afferent VNS may be responsible for initiating Notch signaling in splenic M\u03a6."], ["Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and \u03b2-catenin signaling pathways activated in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) play an important role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis during acute kidney injury (AKI). Four-and-a-half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2), an adaptor protein, has been demonstrated involving in HIF-1 and \u03b2-catenin signaling, respectively. However, the potential effect of FHL2 on AKI remains to be elucidated.", "The expression of FHL2 in PTECs was examined in AKI induced by bilateral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) in mice and in NRK-52E (rat PTECs) cultured in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditions, respectively. Mice with PTECs-specific deletion of FHL2 (Tubule-FHL2-/-) were generated by mating FHL2-floxed mice with Ggt1-Cre transgenic mice. The function of FHL2 in PTECs during AKI was investigated in Tubule-FHL2-/- mice after I/R.", "The expression of FHL2 was upregulated in PTECs during AKI in vivo. Compared with control littermates, Tubule-FHL2-/- mice were phenotypically normal within 2 months after birth but developed more severe kidney dysfunction, tubular cell death, inflammatory cell infiltration and less tubular cell proliferation after I/R. The activation of both HIF-1 and \u03b2-catenin signaling pathways was attenuated in Tubule-FHL2-/- mice after I/R comparing with control littermates. In vitro, the induction of FHL2 was correlated with upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1. Two functional hypoxia responsive elements was identified in the promoter region of FHL2 gene, which interacted with HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxia conditions, suggesting that FHL2 is a novel direct target gene of HIF-1. Overexpression of FHL2 induced physical interactions between FHL2 and HIF-1\u03b1 and between FHL2 and \u03b2-catenin, which promoted HIF-1\u03b1 and \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation, and enhanced the transcriptional activity of their downstream targets, respectively.", "Our results suggest that FHL2, as a downstream target gene of HIF-1, plays a critical protective role in AKI through regulating the activities of HIF-1 and \u03b2-catenin signaling pathways simultaneously, and FHL2 could be a potential future therapeutic target for AKI."], ["Classic mechanisms of renal injury in sarcoidosis include hypercalcemia with afferent vasoconstriction, nephrocalcinosis, and acute interstitial nephritis with or without granulomas. Lysozyme is a small cationic enzyme with bactericidal properties produced by monocytes and macrophages, which drive disease activity. Lysozyme is freely filtered by glomeruli and reabsorbed in proximal tubules (PTs), where it causes toxicity in excessive quantities, known as lysozyme-induced nephropathy.", "75M presented with a creatinine of 5.87 mg/dL (eGFR 9cc/min) after not seeing a physician for years.

BAL showed multinucleated giant cells, consistent with sarcoidosis.", "Rare case reports describe lysozyme-induced nephropathy in sarcoidosis. It is more commonly seen in chronic monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemia, as these clonal populations produce excessive lysozyme. Measurement of serum lysozyme levels could be considered in patients with sarcoidosis and a rising creatinine, or with UPCR and UACR discordance. This may guide future therapies directed at excessive macrophage activity, thereby improving renal function."], ["Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and edema secondary to renal sodium chloride retention. Along the kidney tubule, sodium and chloride reabsorption are coupled via a combination of transcellular and paracellular transport pathways. The mechanism of sodium retention in NS has been extensively studied, but the associated chloride transport pathway has not been elucidated.", "To investigate the pathway of chloride retention in NS, we assessed the expression levels of both paracellular and transcellular components of chloride transport in the CD of POD-ATTAC mice and PAN rats, two rodent models of NS. We also used cultured mouse cortical collecting duct cells to see how overexpression or silencing of claudin-4 affect paracellular permeability. Finally, human renal biopsies were used to confirm our in vivo results.", "In control animals, claudin-4 was expressed at low levels in collecting duct (CD). In POD-ATTAC mice and PAN rats, claudin-4 expression was strongly increased in CD beta-intercalated cells (B-IC) and to a lesser extent in CD principal cells and was also induced in connecting tubules. Similarly, we found that claudin-4 was expressed at low levels in normal human kidneys and was dramatically increased in CD cells of nephrotic human kidneys (focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis). In parallel, the expression of pendrin, which exchanges chloride for bicarbonates in B-IC, was decreased in nephrotic compared to control animals. However, the increase in claudin-4 expression observed in NS is likely independent of pendrin abundance. Increased claudin-4 abundance is coupled with increased ENaC-dependent sodium transport. Overexpression or silencing of claudin-4 in mCCDcl1 cells confirmed the preferential permeability of claudin-4 to chloride over sodium.", "These results suggest that during NS, transcellular Cl-/HCO3- transport decreases while paracellular chloride transport via claudin-4 may increase along the collecting system. Paracellular chloride permeability may constitute a chloride shunt that favors Na+ reabsorption and opposes K+ secretion along the CD in NS."], ["Renal proximal tubules excrete metabolites through unidirectional solute transport systems facilitating active secretion of organic ions into urine. We explored 3 classes of transporters: (1) organic anion transporters (OAT), (2) organic cation transporters (OCT), and (3) aquaporins (AQP).

I/R rats with 33 min of bilateral renal ischemia showed significant decrease of renal OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and AQP1 mRNAs (76%, 92%, 90%, and 61% reduction, respectively). 40 min I/R led to further decrease of these mRNAs. In C57BL/6N mice, OAT2/3, OCT1/2, and AQP1 are highly expressed in the kidney. We also observed significant decrease of these genes in kidney in I/R mice. In cisplatin-induced mouse nephrotoxic AKI, renal OAT2/3, OCT1/2, mRNAs were significantly reduced (>80%), while AQP1 mRNA was down by 65%. In contrast, no reduction of renal OAT2/3 and OCT1/2 mRNAs, nor any increase of kidney injury marker KIM1 were observed at 8 or 24 in CS mouse AKI. Unlike IR induced-tubular necrosis in the renal outer medulla, CS induced vacuolation and tubule dilation in the cortex. We detected low expression of OATs/OCTs in human renal primary proximal epithelial cells which renders it difficult to assess their regulation in vitro.", "Our data show significant downregulation of renal OATs and OCTs in I/R and cisplatin-induced AKI. These reductions might lead to decreased transport activities in the proximal tubule and further deterioration of renal function after injury. The lack of downregulation of renal OATs and OCTs in the CS mouse AKI suggests that the injury of the renal tubule epithelial cells is less in this model."], ["Sodium\u2013glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve renal and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

In 959 patients, clinical data were linked to serum creatinine (N=92,229) exported from our data warehouse. CrCl/eGFR was calculated with Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD, and CKD-EPI, classified according to KDIGO criteria, and compared against each other based on the creatinine before the start of conditioning. Within the current recommendations, the required dose reduction for each cytostatic drug was calculated based on the aforementioned methods.", "CrCl/eGFR show different results depending on the method used. Before conditioning, the proportion of patients with a GFR <60 ml/min was 4.4% (Cockcroft-Gault), 7.1% (MDRD) and 5.0% (CKD-EPI). The need for dose reduction ranged from 0.1% (cyclophosphamide) to 5.8% (fludarabine). In the case of fludarabine, the SmPC recommendation is based on CrCl and requires dose reduction in 8.4% of cases. Using MDRD, reduction would be necessary in 14.2% of cases, 5.8% more than with the SmPC recommendation. Applied to all conditioning regimens, the use of Cockroft-Gault causes the need for action in only a few cases, while MDRD displays a considerably higher rate of dose adjustments (Fig 1).", "Dosing of cytotoxic drugs depends on renal function. Although Cockcroft-Gault is rarely used in the clinic nowadays, many dose adjustments still utilize this method. However, our data show that compared with MDRD or CKD-EPI, Cockcroft-Gault usually overestimates renal function. Since a rapid determination of renal function is currently unavailable, therapeutic success and toxicity predictions are hampered by the use of various methods.", ""], ["Cancer patients undergo frequent CT scans with contrast and may be uniquely predisposed to CA-AKI due to decreased effective circulating volume or concomitant treatment with nephrotoxic chemotherapy.

We used an Artificial Intelligence method called Reinforcement Learning (RL) to discover treatment strategies directly aimed at minimization of Ca and Pi flow out of bone and into vascular smooth muscle. We hypothesized that direct optimization of Ca and Pi flux instead of biochemical proxies would result in improved bone mineral metabolism and reduction in soft tissue calcification.", "We used a QSP model of CKD-MBD to simulate a virtual cohort of 80 ESRD subjects. The RL Agent representing the treatment strategy was implemented as a Deep Neural Network and trained for 10,000 episodes, each episode representing a 5 year treatment period. The RL Agent observed the Ca, Pi, PTH trajectories and adjusted the doses of Pi binder, Calcitriol, and a Calcimimetic on a monthly basis, to minimize the mineral flow out of bone and into soft tissue estimated by the model (Flux RL).

Given its invasive nature and low availability in most centers, biomarkers are most commonly used to diagnose and guide the treatment of RO. Among these biomarkers, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and alkaline phosphatase are widely used, but their predictive value is still questioned. There are few available data comparing BB and bone metabolism biomarkers. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of iPTH and total alkaline phosphatase (TAF) to predict bone turnover in hemodialysis (HD) patients.", "This was a retrospective cross-sectional study in a single center. The medical records of 250 patients who underwent BB from April 2004 to September 2021 were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory data: age, sex, time on HD, iPTH and TAF (due to methodological differences, it was expressed in the number of times it was above the upper limit of normal; xTAF). According to bone turnover, patients were divided into two groups: High turnover, represented by patients with a histological diagnosis of osteitis fibrosa and mixed disease, and Low turnover, comprising those with adynamic bone disease and osteomalacia. To assess iPTH and TAF as predictors of bone turnover, univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed and an ROC curve was produced.", "The median age of patients was 48 years, 57.6% were females, and had been on HD for a median time of 9 years.

The uncoupling of bone formation and resorption can be found in high and low bone turnover conditions. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a main regulator of bone turnover and increased serum PTH levels is a classical alteration of mineral metabolism in CKD. However, the specific effect of PTH on the bone environment in CKD is still unclear.", "To separate these effects, we analyzed bone samples from 76 patients on hemodialysis [grouped according to serum PTH levels: < 130 (n= 28), 130-600 (n= 20) and > 600 pg/ml (n=28)] and 19 healthy controls.

In comparison with healthy controls, PTH<130 group presented a lower osteocytic number, as well as a higher bone expression of DKK1. In patients with PTH>600, we observed a normal osteocytic number and DKK1 expression, but a decrease in bone sclerostin, phosphorylated beta catenin, and osteoprotegerin. Using RNAseq, we found a significant difference in the expression of almost 2,000 genes between CKD and healthy controls. CKD was associated with an increase in inflammatory signaling, cell death, and impairment of osteoblastic differentiation and bone quantity. In contrast, these changes were attenuated in patients with PTH>600, showing a significant increase in the expression of genes associated with fibrosis, matrix proteins and remodeling. In addition, the increase in PTH did not influence the genes related to bone quantity.", "Using an unprecedented approach, we showed that CKD bone disease is characterized by an increased expression of markers related to suppression in bone formation. An increase in PTH favors bone resorption more significantly than bone formation further aggravating the formation/resorption uncoupling. These findings help us to better understand the complex physiopathology of renal osteodystrophy, creating a perspective of new therapeutic strategies for these patients."], ["With the aging of patients on hemodialysis (HD), the prevalence of osteoporosis (OP) and sarcopenia (SP) is increasing in the HD population.

In line with this finding, protein 4.1O decreases c-myc transactivation. MLC phosphorylation is not altered by 4.1O splice variants in high, low glucose or mannitol. Protein 4.1O (lacking the FERM domain and a c-terminal domain) reduces podocyte migration.", "Expression of protein 4.1O is increased in human diabetic kidney disease and under high glucose conditions. Protein 4.1O splice variants have differential effects on c-myc transactivation, YAP/TAZ activation and migration. This improved understanding of protein 4.1O splice variant function helps to better understand its role in diabetic nephropathy."], ["Identifying the genetic factors influencing diabetic kidney disease (DKD) susceptibility remains challenging.

All of the 17 ESKD-associated miRNAs were detected in both specimens, however, the relationship between concentration in exosomes and plasma were different between protective and risk miRNAs. Among the 9 protective miRNAs, 4 had similar concentration in plasma and exosomes, and 5 were significantly higher in plasma than in exosomes. Among the 8 risk miRNAs, all had low concentrations in exosomes and dramatically higher (5\u2013400 fold) in plasma.", "This study shows that the majority of the ESKD-associated miRNAs have low concentrations in exosomes but very high in plasma, indicating that the ESKD-associated miRNAs are present mainly in non-exosomal plasma fraction. Mechanisms of their release into circulation and uptake by target tissue(s) are unknown but differ from those for the miRNAs transported mainly in exosomes.

Silencing of Nox5 attenuated high glucose induced gene expression of markers of fibrosis and inflammation as well as downregulation of EGR-1, PKC-\u03b1 and TXNIP. Our data also suggest that Nox5 appears to be upstream of Nox4 and that Nox5 inhibition also downregulates Nox4, but not vice versa.

Of these patients, shift 4 patients had a significant higher mean age compared to other shifts (p=0.001) and significant higher number of widows (8.6%, P=0.007). Most pf the patients in all shifts were high school educated but with significant trend to loss of their jobs due to employer attitude in shift 4 (28.6% compared to 13.2%,10.5% and 9.3% in sifts 1-3, p=0.001)). The patients in all four groups are comparable in terms of transportation methods, travel abroad, number of missed sessions weekly, nursing vascular access care, hemodialysis session related complications, exercise performance. Shift 4 was associated with more flexible social life, p=0.020). Shifts 1 and 2 have high admission rates to the hospital (31.1% and 26.3%, respectively) compared to (9.3% and 7.2%, in shift 3 and 4, p=0.004)) with no significant difference in the causes of admission being the infections and cardiovascular morbidities are commonest causes.

The quality of the results obtained through PROMs depends on the psychometric properties with which the instrument quantifies the construct of interest in each population.\n\nObjective\n\nTo establish the psychometric properties of the KDQOL-36 instrument in Colombian dialysis patients.", "Scale validation study carried out in adult hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients treated at Baxter Renal Care Services (BRCS) network, in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia to whom the KDQOL-36 instrument was applied. The clinimetric properties assessed were content validity, internal consistency, reliability analysis through test-retest method, applying the instrument in a second moment, 8-10 days after, criterion validity through concurrent validity, with the application of the Kidney Disease Questionnaire (KDQ) at the same time; and the sensitivity to change, applying the instrument in a second moment, after an event that could generate a change in the construct.", "A sample of 506 patients were included (table 1). Regarding content validity, the exploratory factor analysis confirmed an adequate adjustment of the model (figure 1). Item 28 did not obtain an adequate factorial load in any of the three domains. For internal consistency the McDonald's \u03c9, GLB and Cronbach's alpha coefficients showed values \u2265 0.89. Adequate test-retest reliability was confirmed with a Lin's correlation-concordance coefficients \u2265 0.77 and Bland and Altman plots evidencing a high level of concordance (figure 2).
