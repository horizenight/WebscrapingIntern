In this study we aim to identify a correlation between abnormal K levels and mortality in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients may likely optimize inpatient management.", "Using an observational database, we analyzed 3310 unvaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 PCR-positive patients at Methodist Health System from March 2020 to December 2020. We compared in-hospital death or hospice referral rates between patients with normal K levels (K= 3.5 to 5.0meQ/L), hypokalemia (K < 3.5meQ/L), or hyperkalemia (K > 5.0meQ/L) on first encounter. Chi-square (X2) and odds ratio tests were used to analyze observed variables.", "Of the 3310 COVID-19 patients, 463 (14.0%) died in the hospital or were discharged to hospice and 2747 (86.0%) were discharged home or to a post-acute care facility. In this study cohort, 285 (8.6%) patients had hyperkalemia, 453 (13.7%) had hypokalemia, and 2572 (77.7%) had normal K levels. Patients with abnormal K levels on initial encounter had a higher mortality rate than those who had normal K levels (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 \u2013 1.64, p = 0.02). However, upon closer examination we found that hyperkalemia had a strong association with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients compared to normal K levels (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.49 \u2013 2.69, p < 0.001); however, hypokalemia did not (p = 0.66).", "Hyperkalemia on presentation is associated with a significantly increased risk of in-hospital death or hospice discharge among hospitalized COVID-19 patients."], ["SARs-CoV-2 causes a disease unlike any we have seen before. The virus is similar to some, but the resultant disease is vastly different in the short and long term. This appears to be due to the Cytokine Storm (CS). The connection between COVID and the CS is likely related to Angiotensin II. Specifically, the Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor (AT1R) which is regulated via the ACE2 Receptor (ACE2R). The AT1R pathway is the primary pro-inflammatory pathway that promotes endothelial activation, cellular recruitment and differentiation, T and B cell co-stimulation, and complement activation. This would explain the exact findings in the Cytokine Storm.", "Extensive literature search including international publications and presentations as well as clinical experience. Direct clinical observation of the impact of RAAS on pathophysiology in COVID patients.", "The connection between COVID and the ACE2 Receptor (ACE2R) is the best explanation for the CS. COVID induced ACE2R endocytosis, decreased expression, and decreased transcription facilitates unchecked activation of AT1R. In addition to controlling AT1R mediated endothelial inflammation, the ACE2R is also the regulatory mechanism for the Bradykinin mediated coagulation pathway. This would enhance the explanation of not just the inflammation, but the clotting as well.", "The ACE2R and AT1R connection is the best explanation for the tissue damage from COVID. AT1R mediated inflammation and vascular complications would explain the laboratory findings, histology findings, and clinical symptoms found in the Cytokine Storm. Furthermore, one of the key differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other recent virus outbreaks is the affinity with which SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2R. It has the highest binding affinity of all current coronaviruses. This may explain the different outcomes in certain patients also. Any patients that would be at a higher RAAS baseline (Diabetes, Kidney Disease, Heart Disease) would be more likely to have complications. This is what we have seen clinically. Finally, this pathway gives us a mechanism for certain therapies that have shown promise such as Tocilizumab and Baricitinib. It also offers further treatment potentials for RAAS. In my experience, adequate blood pressures and ongoing diuresis are beneficial.

This is a grey zone with no clear answers, consensus or treatment protocols. Renal parameter used to define AKI is creatinine (Cr). In AKI, Cr relates to glomerular function and does not represent true tubular injury. Is the AKI present on admission (CRS) or developed with the use of diuretics?\nIn patients that receive diuretics, elevation of Cr could be due to: i) Redistribution of fluid occurs within different body compartments. Increase in Cr is a reflection of changed hemodynamic and hormonal changes. ii) hypovolemia with prerenal state due to diuresis- as kidney sees less volume, it will increase reabsorption of Na, Urea, Uric acid, Creatinine, leading to elevated Cr and Bun. At this stage, there is no anatomic injury to the nephrons. iii) True AKI - either directly from long standing CRS or persistant hypovolemia from aggressive diuresis, ATN develops. Here, there is real damage to the tubules. It is a common myth that Lasix is nephrotoxic. In reality, Lasix is not Nephrotoxic. But why does the creatinine rise with diuretics? It is due to the hypovolemia, prerenal state caused by Lasix. Lasix does not cause direct toxic injury to the tubules.\niv) Acute GN- Patient has concomitant Glomerulo nephritis unrelated to CRS. v) ineffective diuresis due to hypoalbuminemia as albumin is the carrier for Lasix to the site of action in renal tubules. vi) Nephrotic syndrome- albumin in the tubules binds Lasix and effective circulatory Lasix is reduced. i-iii - not associated with true renal tubule damage.

Given the blasts noted on peripheral smear, the patient was suspected to have acute leukemia, and an infectious and autoimmune work up was also sent. He was transferred to our hospital for management. Repeat peripheral blood film revealed spherocytes without increased blasts, and flow cytometry was consistent with a leukemoid reaction. Coomb\u2019s test was negative. The patient had rapid clinical deterioration requiring hemodynamic support in the ICU. He developed oligoanuric acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal replacement therapy was initiated.\n\nUrinalysis at that time showed bile pigmented casts and no other microscopic signs of glomerular injury.

When present, extracutaneous manifestations usually involve kidneys, joints and gastrointestinal tract. Reported renal involvement includes an increase in creatinine, tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute renal failure1. Different etiologies include medications, infections and malignancies. Compared to other drug induced LCV incidence, VA-LCV cases with involvement of the kidneys are rare. Onset of VA-LCV ranges from within 24hrs to as late as 1 month after drug initiation. Diagnosis is made with punch skin biopsy. Most cases are self-limited and resolve with withdrawal of vancomycin and recovery time ranges from days to weeks3.\nIn our patient, the temporal timing between initiating vancomycin and appearance of the rash and increase in creatinine level strongly suggests that the LCV was related to vancomycin.

The decrease in lactate clearance occurs in severe liver disease. Treatment of type B lactic acidosis is directed toward treating the underlying malignancy. In this case, increased lactate production by tumor cells and decreased hepatic lactate clearance caused type B lactic acidosis. The decreased hepatic lactate clearance was due to metastatic liver disease.

HTN is one of the most common CVAEs reported. Oxidative stress on cardiac myocytes, increase in vascular tone and reactivity, vascular dysfunction caused by endothelial effects of proteasome inhibition are proposed mechanisms for CVAE and HTN associated with Carfilzomib. Nifedipine and nitroglycerin can reduce spasmogenic effect of carfilzomib.

In this case, while the patient had microalbuminuria, alpha-2-globulin was the most elevated component on her UPEP (Figure 1). Alpha-2-globulin is usually increased as an acute-phase reactant; however, it also contains haptoglobin. During hemolysis, hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes can form and create a large band in the alpha-2-globulin region. Given the hemolysis confirmed on her other laboratory workup, this patient\u2019s proteinuria was likely due to formation of such complexes, with possible contribution from microalbuminuria and/or false positive urine dipstick.

At 21:29, patient's blood pressure plummeted from 116/60 to 40/18 and she had simultaneous desaturation to mid 80s with elevated peak airway pressures. Fortunately, the surgeon was able to abort the procedure just seconds before the skin incision was made. To combat anaphylaxis, patient was given 3 doses of intramuscular epinephrine and started on norepinephrine infusion prior to being transferred to the ICU. She was eventually stabilized and discharged 36 hours later. Luckily the 'uncontaminated' kidney was reallocated to another local recipient.

Pre-operative skin prick testing to Cefazolin, which is the most frequently used antibiotic in kidney TX surgery, could have prevented this case scenario. Furthermore, a sensitive assay should be established for pre-op allergy evaluation.

Graft was removed, flushed with heparin/alteplase and reimplanted with doppler-confirmed BF. After closure BF was not detected with diminished Rt lower extremity pulses. The graft was necrotic and removed. Thrombi were removed from the Rt common/ iliac, femoral and popliteal arteries. HD was restarted with heparin. Within hours, thrombocytopenia worsened. Elevated D-dimer and positive platelet factor-4 antibodies (PF-4Ab) suggested heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) despite negative serotonin release assay (SRA). Heparin was changed to argatroban then apixiban. Following resolved thrombocytopenia and negative PF-4 Ab, she had a second LUKT on therapeutic argatroban. She again had AGT with intrarenal, RV and RA thrombi requiring graft removal. Workup showed positive Coombs and negative heparin Ab, suggestive of Ab-mediated consumptive coagulopathy consistent with vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).", "Initially HIT was presumed, and heparin discontinued, yet AGT occurred despite heparin avoidance. Thus, symptoms were more consistent with VITT, a syndrome that can occur after COVID-19 vaccines with adenovirus vector. Yet, she was not vaccinated.
