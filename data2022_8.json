of the most common manifestations affecting 45% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here we present a case of rapid progression of LN in the setting of recent COVID-19 infection, suggesting a possible synergistic cascade of cytokines contributing to rapid disease flare up.", "52-year-old hispanic lady with past medical history of hypertension and newly diagnosed SLE presented to the clinic with chief complaint of generalized anasarca, fatigue and low back ache. She was found to have a hemoglobin of 8.8 along with severe leukopenia. Urinalysis was positive for large amount of blood, protein with a protein: creatinine ratio of 9 gm. ANA titer was positive along with low levels of C3 complement and normal levels of C4 complement. Creatinine of 2.3 which was 4 times higher than her baseline. Labs from 2 months ago showed creatinine of 0.57 . Of note, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 a month ago. She had a renal biopsy and was diagnosed with stage IV LN and was started on dialysis.", "LN usually has an indolent course with people developing ESRD within 5 years of diagnosis of lupus. This case strikes out as a rapid progression of LN with progression to ESRD within less than 3 months of diagnosis of SLE. COVID-19 a few months before she was diagnosed with Lupus is a possible source of a cytokine storm. Suggested mechanisms of induction of autoimmunity include both molecular mimicry as well as bystander activation whereby the infection may lead to activation of antigen presenting cells that may in turn activate pre-primed auto-reactive T-cells, thus leading to pro-inflammatory mediators, which in turn may lead to tissue damage. Strategies to prevent rapid progression to ESRD in these patients needs to be studied and better understood. Perhaps patients with autoimmune conditions like SLE need more robust management of diseases like COVID-19 which is known to alter and activate the immunological cascade. As per recent literature exaggerated extrafollicular B cell response characteristic of active SLE also characterizes the B cell response to COVID-19. Understanding and targeting the B cell pathway could potentially help dampen a severe response and disease progression. Overlap including racial preponderance of disease severity also needs to be studied further."], ["Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir+ ritonavir) is a promising new combination drug that can significantly reduce hospitalization and all-cause mortality in Covid-19 infection. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome-P450 system CYP3A enzymes and concomitant use with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) such as tacrolimus can dangerously increase CNI blood levels. We present a heart transplant recipient on tacrolimus who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) and refractory life-threatening hyperkalemia following Paxlovid use and successful treatment using P450 induction with phenytoin along with dialysis support.", "A 43-year-old male with CKD stage III and previous heart transplant on tacrolimus was admitted with dyspnea, malaise, and oliguria. Few days earlier, he developed Covid-19 infection and received 5-day course of Paxlovid prescribed from elsewhere. On presentation, patient was hypervolemic, with the following serum values: K+ 7.1 mMol/L (peaking to 8.3 despite medical therapy), HCO3- 17 mMol/L and creatinine 4.67 mg/dL (baseline 3.0). Patient required emergent hemodialysis. Tacrolimus trough level came back as >60 ng/mL Patient was started on IV phenytoin 100 mg every 12 hours.Tacrolimus levels remained extremely high over next few days with subsequent improvement (fig.). Patient required 4 dialysis sessions. Subsequently urine output improved, and serum creatinine returned to baseline.", "Paxlovid use will likely increase with Covid-19 surge. This drug has important safety risks in organ transplant recipients and kidney disease as highlighted by our case, where supratherapeutic tacrolimus levels due to P450 inhibition resulted in AKI and hyperkalemia. Empiric dose reduction or withholding CNI agents when initiating Paxlovid with close CNI level monitoring is recommended. Risk mitigation strategies are also important such as interruptive alerts in electronic health records, educational outreach, and alerting pharmacies about Paxlovid-CNI interactions.", "Serial K+ and Tac levels"], ["Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to poor response to vaccination and immunosuppression. Antiviral therapies are thus important to mitigate risk of severe disease. Nirmaltrelvir/ritonavir, an oral antiviral, has increasingly been used in higher risk patients with COVID-19. Unique to transplant patients is the risk of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) drug interaction and potential for severe drug toxicity.", "A 57-year-old male received a kidney transplant 8 months ago. Immunosuppression includes tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone, and he was fully vaccinated and boosted against SARS-CoV-2. He presented with headache, fevers, and body aches and COVID antigen test was positive. His primary care provider prescribed nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and immunosuppression was continued. Two days later he developed nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue prompting emergency evaluation. It was unclear if symptoms were drug-related or due to COVID-19 infection. Given the high risk of severe COVID-19, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was continued, and tacrolimus was held. Two days later, tacrolimus level was checked and resulted at 75.6 ng/mL, complicated by acute kidney injury. He was admitted, treated with intravenous fluids and phenytoin to enhance CNI metabolism. Symptoms and graft function improved, and tacrolimus level decreased but remained high 2 days later (54 ng/mL). Tacrolimus remained on hold at discharge and was restarted when level normalized.", "Nirmatrelvir inhibits Mpro, a protease enzyme required for SARS-CoV-2 replication. As a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may interact with drugs metabolized through this pathway, including CNIs. This patient\u2019s tacrolimus level was severely elevated even after 2 days of drug cessation leading to toxicity and hospitalization. Use of nirmatrelvir/ritonovir with CNIs requires extreme caution. The antiviral benefit may be opposed by risks incurred through drug interaction. If used, we recommend holding or reducing the CNI dose and close monitoring of levels. Providers and patients should be educated about this interaction, and alternative treatments may be preferable."], ["Lupus nephritis is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. About 40-60% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus will have renal involvement. We present a case of a young lady with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who additionally presented with alopecia, arthritis and acute renal injury. Initially, the consulting team presumed the diagnosis to be due to lupus nephritis. The patient was treated with IV methylprednisolone and oral prednisone. The renal biopsy revealed widespread calcium phosphate crystals within the tubular lumens, suggestive of acute phosphate nephropathy. Electron microscopy showed diffuse foot process effacement consistent with minimal change disease.", "A 20-year-old lady with no past medical history presented with right-sided chest pain, myalgias, fever, and vomiting for 5-6 days. She had proteinuria and serum creatinine of 5 mg/dl. She was SARS-CoV-2 positive. She also had frontal alopecia and photosensitivity over the past five months, along with swelling/tenderness in her wrists and MCPs over the past year. The patient\u2019s mother had a diagnosis of lupus which was well controlled on Hydroxychloroquine. Further lab work revealed lymphopenia, positive for smith, coombs, cryoglobulins, RF, RNP, and SSA. Other pertinent work-up was negative. The patient was started on induction therapy for possible lupus nephritis of 1 g IV solumedrol daily for three days. The patient progressively became anuric, and creatinine peaked to 8 mg/dl. Dialysis was initiated. Her urine output improved after the third dialysis session, and dialysis was stopped. Her creatinine improved to 2.4 mg/dl. After the biopsy confirmed phosphate nephropathy, a focused history failed to reveal a cause. She denied sodium phosphate bowel preparations, consuming star fruit or ethylene glycol exposure.", "This case shows the importance of biopsy even in a well-known condition such as lupus nephritis. The etiology of renal failure in SARS-CoV-2 is primarily acute tubular necrosis, with collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis also reported. Calcium phosphate deposition is not a reported complication of COVID-19 or lupus nephritis. The tubuloreticular inclusions can be found with lupus nephritis and viral infection. The etiology of phosphate-induced nephropathy remains unclear."], ["Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a very common complication of patients with SARS-COV-2 virus (COVID-19) infection. COVID-19 infected patients have longer hospital length of stays and higher mortality rate. There are multiple postulated mechanisms for AKI in the setting of COVID-19. Some researchers reported that the COVID-19 virus directly binds to the ACE-2 receptors in proximal tubules and leads to tubular dysfunction. In rare cases, a hypercatabolic state can be seen that carries a significantly higher mortality rate with ensuing hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia.", "We describe a patient presenting with severe AKI with hypercatabolic state in the setting of COVID-19 infection. 40 year old male with a history of hypertension and CHF (EF 35%) presented with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting for 10 days after COVID-19 infection. He was found to have severe AKI with blood urea nitrogen of 254 and creatinine of 21 mg/dl which was associated with hyperkalemia, gap acidosis, severe hyperuricemia (23 mg/dl) and hyperphosphatemia (17 mg/dl) . Despite aggressive volume resuscitation in the ICU, the patient remained oliguric with no improvement in kidney function for two days. He was subsequently initiated on hemodialysis. After getting 2 sessions of dialysis without ultrafiltration, renal recovery was noted eventually normalizing within 10 days. Extensive work up indicated the patient had no tumor lysis syndrome and rhabdomyolysis on this admission.", "There are multifactorial mechanisms for AKI in patients with COVID-19 infection including direct viral invasion of the kidney proximal tubules. Our case demonstrated that a hypercatabolic state may contribute to AKI in these patients. The proposed mechanisms involve elevated serum uric acid levels causing small renal arterial constriction, glomerular auto-dysregulation and tubular crystallization due to supersaturation causing to kidney tubular injury. Thus, clearance of uric acid and phosphorus with dialysis may promote more rapid kidney function recovery.", ""], ["Emergency use authorization and mass vaccination programs worldwide have lowered the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine complications not previously seen in clinical studies continue to manifest. We present a case of membranous nephropathy (MN) following the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with successful treatment.", "Our patient is a 58-year-old woman with past medical history of hypothyroidism seen at a nephrology clinic for evaluation of new onset symptoms of dyspnea, severe bilateral pedal edema, and proximal muscle weakness for 4 months. The patient had 3+ proteinuria and microscopic hematuria on urinalysis obtained by primary care provider. She also had a rapid decline in serum albumin to 2.2 g/dL and new onset hypercholesteremia at 415 mg/dL. Before initial presentation, she had normal labs and no symptoms.\nUpon presentation to our nephrology clinic, the patient had proteinuria of 2,360 mg/day on a 24-hour urine collection, random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 5,459 mg/g and random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 3,539 mg/g. She had no risk factors for chronic kidney disease. The only recent change in the health management of the patient was the administration of two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine several weeks prior to presenting with her initial symptoms 4 months ago.\nThe phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibody was elevated at 287 IU/mL. Serological tests for other sources of proteinuria were negative. Renal biopsy performed was consistent with primary MN. The patient was started on rituximab infusion given 2 weeks apart based on Mentor Trial. Additional treatment included apixaban, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim DS, losartan, and L-carnitine.\nAfter two doses of rituximab, she had resolution of dyspnea, pedal edema and muscle weakness. Repeat labs revealed UPCR to 1000 mg/g, UACR to 629 mg/g, improvement of PLA2R to 8 IU/mL. Our patient achieved immunological remission and partial clinical remission.", "This case illustrates a potential association of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and autoimmune mimicry leading to MN. We hope that this will help clinicians become aware of a potential complication not widely recognized and an effective management strategy. We hope further investigations of this possible association are performed as more cases are discovered."], ["While the development, delivery, and implementation of the mRNA vaccines have been spectacular, consideration for potential rare side effects on organ systems was not clear. Although emergency use authorization trials of these vaccines in the USA did not demonstrate major safety concerns, unique side effects after mass-scale vaccination are now being reported more frequently. Here, we describe a case of new-onset crescentic & sclerosing GN with linear basement membrane staining for IgG, kappa, and lambda by Immunofluorescence in a 30-yo healthy female three days after receiving her Tozinameran (Pfizer-BioNTech) booster vaccine.", "30 y/o Caucasian female with no PMH presented with a CC of gross hematuria 3 days after receiving her booster of Tozinameran. Retrospectively reported symptoms of pedal edema, generalized athralgia, tinnitus, and paresthesia of lower limbs. UA revealed dysmorphic RBCs and proteinuria. CT urethrogram, & cystoscopy revealed left hydronephrosis, no nephrolithiasis or urothelial lesions. Kidney biopsy revealed crescentic & sclerosis GN, with linear GBM staining for IgG, Kappa, & Lambda on IF. Several glomeruli showed segmental scars & fibrous crescents in addition to focal cellular crescents of varying ages raising the possibility of concurrent ANCA vasculitis. Her GBM antibody was 25. Additional workup of ANCA, PLA2R, PR3, ana, c3/c4 levels, dsDNA, and hepatitis studies returned negative. On admission, BP was 175/103, and HR 104. Labs were notable for hemoglobin 13.3, WBC 16.6k, & BUN/creatinine 16/1.5. The PE was unremarkable. She received pulse IV steroid therapy, cyclophosphamide, Lupron, and daily plasma exchange (PLEX) for 5 days until her GBM antibody cleared. She responded well to treatment. Her renal function improved, and she was discharged without requiring dialysis.", "Our case demonstrates a possible correlation & causation scenario after receiving a Tozinameran booster shot activating anti-GBM disease with concurrent ANCA-negative vasculitis demonstrated by kidney biopsy. Although the mechanism of de novo anti-GBM disease & ANCA-negative vasculitis post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine remains to be explained, pharmacovigilance is vital in our efforts to ascertain answers."], ["The evidence suggests that the primary events in AKI occur on the luminal surface of the endothelial cells in the microvasculature of kidney. These findings can be explained by the activation of the complement resulting in endothelial injury. Ravulizumab inhibits the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b thus preventing endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we report the use of ravulizumab to treat AKI in the setting of COVID-19 infection with focus on a primary follow-up period of 30 days.", "Patients were randomized in a placebo-controlled fashion. One group received placebo and standard care (SOC) while the second group received SOC and ravulizumab. Outcomes were rigorously assessed for 30 days after enrollment.", "13 (11.4% of screened) patients identified to have COVID-19 infection were enrolled in the study. Six patients were randomized to receive ravulizumab in addition to standard of care (SOC+R) and seven patients were randomized to SOC.Three patients randomized to the SOC group died after enrollment. Mean number of hospital free days after enrollment was 290\u00b147 (SOC+R) vs 164\u00b1144 (SOC) respectively. Free C5 levels increased over 30 days following ravulizumab infusion and corresponded with decreasing ravulizumab blood levels over the same time interval (p=0.001). During this same time period there was a decreased number of anuric days observed in the SOC+R compared to SOC (p=0.009). There was a reduced frequency of dialysis events in the SOC+R for ten days after enrollment (p=0.001).", "Due to the recurrent impact of COVID-19 infection throughout the world, targeted therapies for concomitant kidney injury merit future investigations to reduce incidence of AKI and potentially reduce future prevalence of CKD.", ""], ["Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a known complication of COVID-19. Recent reports have suggested a decrease in AKI incidence with time. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of AKI over time and determine whether changes in patients\u2019 characteristics could explain this decrease.", "Data were selected from the Cerner Real-World DataTM, a cloud-based platform of de-identified electronic health records data from >100 health systems. Our study population was defined as hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in 2020-2021. We excluded patients with known end-stage kidney disease and those whose first interaction with the health system was the COVID-related hospitalization. AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine by \u22650.3 mg/dl within 48 hours or \u22651.5 times the baseline. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between time categorized in quarters and occurrence of AKI after adjusting for demographic variables and comorbidities identified from the Elixhauser ICD10-based algorithm. To determine whether the effect of demographic and comorbidities on the likelihood of AKI varied with time, we also ran separate logistic regression models for each quarter.", "Our analytical dataset included 152,296 patients. Of those 49% were female, 12% black, 71% white, 29% Hispanic, mean age was 61\u00b119, 32% had diabetes, 55% hypertension, 14% Kidney Disease, 20% coronary artery disease, 14% congestive heart failure, 24% COPD, 10% liver disease and 21% developed AKI while hospitalized. The incidence of AKI decreased from 28% in 2020 quarter one (2020Q1) to 19% in 2021Q4 (test of trend p<0.001). The odds of developing AKI for 2020Q2 to 2021Q4 compared to 2020Q1 were Odds Ratio=0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.89, 0.73 (0.66-0.81), 0.72 (0.66-0.80), 0.72 (0.65-0.80), 0.58 (0.53-0.65), 0.67 (0.60-0.74), 0.61 (0.52-0.71) respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the effect of time although attenuated (highest 2020Q2 OR=0.79 (0.71-0.88), lowest 2021Q4 OR=0.67 (0.58-0.79) remained significant. Time did not modify the effect of the demographic variables and comorbidities on developing AKI.", "The decrease in AKI incidence with time is independent of the effect of demographic risk factors and comorbidities. This decrease is likely related to improvement in patients volume management, treatment with steroids, anticoagulation and early treatment of the virus."], ["Kidney injury in acute COVID-19 infection has been associated with decreased survival and prolonged duration of hospitalization irrespective of patient population or severity of illness. Outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and kidney injury in terms of recovery of renal function are insufficiently assessed.

Mg homeostasis is affected by kidney function, acid-base status, calcium-vitamin D alterations, and medications (eg, immunosuppressants, citrate). The active form, ionized Mg (iMg), is not measured, and studies conflict regarding total (tMg) and iMg correlation.
